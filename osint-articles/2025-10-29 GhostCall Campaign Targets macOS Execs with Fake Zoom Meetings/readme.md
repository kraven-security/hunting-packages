# GhostCall Campaign Targets macOS Execs with Fake Zoom Meetings

The BlueNoroff hacking group (part of Lazarus) is targeting tech and VC executives on macOS with a sophisticated new campaign. Attackers use social engineering on platforms like Telegram to lure victims into malicious, "Zoom-like" phishing sites for fake investment meetings.

Key takeaways:

üëª Advanced Social Engineering: Targets are invited to a fake Zoom call that appears legitimate, even playing recordings of other victims to build trust before claiming there's an audio issue.

üö® Fake Update Trojan: The site prompts the victim to download a "Zoom client update" to fix the "problem." This file is a malicious script that downloads and installs a backdoor.

üîí Info-Stealing Payload: The malware, including a backdoor dubbed 'CosmicDoor,' is designed to harvest sensitive files from the compromised Mac, specifically targeting password managers (like 1Password, LastPass), note-taking apps, and Telegram data.

üõ°Ô∏è High-Value Targets: This campaign is not random; it is a highly-targeted operation focused on C-suite executives and venture capitalists, demonstrating a clear financial motive.
