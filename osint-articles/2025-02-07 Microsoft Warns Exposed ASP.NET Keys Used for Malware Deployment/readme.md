# Microsoft Warns Exposed ASP.NET Keys Used for Malware Deployment

Microsoft has issued a warning about attackers deploying malware through ViewState code injection by exploiting exposed ASP.NET machine keys. They recommend developers generate secure keys, encrypt sensitive data, and upgrade to ASP.NET 4.8.

Key takeaways:

⚠️ Attack Method: Attackers are using static ASP.NET keys found online to deploy malware via ViewState code injection.

🔑 Security Advice: Microsoft urges developers to generate unique machine keys securely and not to use default or exposed keys.

🔒 Encryption: Encrypting machineKey and connectionStrings elements is advised to prevent access to plaintext secrets.

🛡️ Upgrade: Developers are recommended to upgrade applications to ASP.NET 4.8 to leverage Antimalware Scan Interface capabilities.

🖥️ Server Hardening: Enhance server security by applying attack surface reduction rules to block webshell creation.
