# Silver Fox Threat Actor Exploits Microsoft-Signed Driver

A new campaign by the threat actor dubbed "Silver Fox" has been identified, showcasing the abuse of a legitimate Microsoft-signed WatchDog driver to deploy the ValleyRAT malware. This technique allows the malware to bypass security measures by piggybacking on a trusted and verified component.

Key takeaways:

🔒 Abuse of Trust: Attackers are exploiting the trust placed in signed drivers, turning a security feature into a vector for compromise.

🚨 New RAT Variant: The campaign delivers ValleyRAT, a remote access trojan, giving attackers control over the infected systems.

💡 Defense Evasion: Using signed drivers is a sophisticated method to evade detection by endpoint security solutions that may trust any process initiated by a signed binary.

🛡️ Driver Monitoring is Crucial: Security teams must monitor for unusual driver installation and activity, even from trusted vendors, to detect this kind of abuse.

🌐 Constant Vigilance: This incident is a stark reminder that threat actors are continuously evolving their tactics to exploit even the most secure environments.
