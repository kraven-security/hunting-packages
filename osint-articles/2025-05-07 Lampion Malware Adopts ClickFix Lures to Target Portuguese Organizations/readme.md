# Lampion Malware Adopts ClickFix Lures to Target Portuguese Organizations

Lampion malware operators are using ClickFix social engineering lures to trick Portuguese users into executing malicious PowerShell commands, targeting government, finance, and transportation sectors. The campaign, active since December 2024, deploys phishing emails with fake tax authority sites to steal sensitive banking data.

Key takeaways:

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Targeted Campaign Uncovered: Lampion malware, active since 2019, targets Portuguese organizations in government, finance, and transportation using ClickFix lures, a social engineering tactic adopted since late 2024 to steal banking information.

üìß Phishing Infection Chain: The attack begins with phishing emails containing malicious ZIP files, leading to a fake Portuguese tax authority site that prompts victims to copy and execute malicious PowerShell commands.

üíª ClickFix Technique: Victims are tricked into running commands via the Run dialog, downloading obfuscated VBS scripts that execute in non-consecutive stages, complicating detection.

üîç Sophisticated TTPs: The campaign uses highly obfuscated VB scripts, indirect execution, and infrastructure mimicking legitimate services, consistent with prior Lampion tactics.

üõ°Ô∏è Defense Recommendations: Organizations should educate staff on ClickFix risks, monitor PowerShell and clipboard activity, and use solutions like Cortex XDR to detect and block Lampion‚Äôs malicious activities.
