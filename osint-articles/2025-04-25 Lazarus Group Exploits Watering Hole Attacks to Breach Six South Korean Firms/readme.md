# Lazarus Group Exploits Watering Hole Attacks to Breach Six South Korean Firms

North Korea‚Äôs Lazarus Group hacked six South Korean software, IT, finance, and telecom companies using watering hole attacks and zero-day exploits in Cross EX and Innorix Agent. Kaspersky‚Äôs findings on Operation SyncHole reveal lightweight, modular malware targeting supply chains.

Key takeaways:

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Watering Hole Strategy: Lazarus compromised legitimate South Korean media portals with server-side scripts to profile visitors, redirecting targets to malicious domains mimicking software vendors like Cross EX, a tool for secure online banking and government interactions.

ü¶† Zero-Day Exploits: The group exploited vulnerabilities in Cross EX and a one-day flaw in Innorix Agent, deploying ThreatNeedle and other modular malware for espionage and lateral movement across networks.

üîç Targeted Sectors: Since November 2024, the campaign has targeted software, IT, finance, and telecommunications firms, focusing on supply chains. Kaspersky shared findings with KrCERT/CC to patch the affected software.

‚ö†Ô∏è Evolving Tactics: Operation SyncHole shows Lazarus adopting stealthier, configurable tools, highlighting the need for robust supply chain security and vigilance against socially engineered attacks.
