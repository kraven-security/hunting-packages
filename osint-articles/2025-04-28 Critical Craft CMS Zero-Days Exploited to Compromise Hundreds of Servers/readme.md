# Critical Craft CMS Zero-Days Exploited to Compromise Hundreds of Servers

Hackers are actively exploiting two Craft CMS zero-days (CVE-2025-32432, CVE-2024-58136), breaching ~300 of 13,000 vulnerable servers since Feb 2025. Update to patched versions (3.9.15, 4.14.15, 5.6.17) to block remote code execution attacks.

Key takeaways:

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Zero-Day Exploitation: Threat actors chained CVE-2024-58136 (CVSS 9.0, Yii PHP flaw) and CVE-2025-32432 (CVSS 10.0, RCE in image transformation) to access restricted resources and execute code, compromising ~300 of 13,000 vulnerable Craft CMS servers since February 14, 2025.

üîç Attack Mechanism: CVE-2025-32432 exploits unauthenticated POST requests to the ‚Äúactions/assets/generate-transform‚Äù endpoint, allowing malicious code execution, with Orange Cyberdefense SensePost noting suspicious ‚Äú\_\_class‚Äù strings in request bodies.

üõ°Ô∏è Patches and Mitigation: Craft CMS patched the flaws in versions 3.9.15, 4.14.15, and 5.6.17; admins should update, check logs for compromise, refresh security keys, rotate database credentials, and block malicious requests at the firewall.

‚ö†Ô∏è Ongoing Risks: Unpatched servers remain at high risk, with evidence of scanning via POST requests; admins must act swiftly to prevent data theft and further system compromise.
