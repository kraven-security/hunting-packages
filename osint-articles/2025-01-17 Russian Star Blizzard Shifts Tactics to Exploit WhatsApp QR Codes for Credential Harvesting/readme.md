# Russian Star Blizzard Shifts Tactics to Exploit WhatsApp QR Codes for Credential Harvesting

The Russian hacking group Star Blizzard has escalated its spear-phishing efforts by exploiting WhatsApp QR codes to compromise accounts, particularly targeting diplomats, Ukraine supporters, and defense officials. This new method involves sending messages with malicious QR codes that lead to credential theft.

Key takeaways:

ðŸ”„ Tactic Evolution: Star Blizzard, previously known as SEABORGIUM, has shifted from traditional email phishing to using WhatsApp QR codes for spear-phishing campaigns.

ðŸ“± QR Code Exploit: The group sends messages with QR codes that, when scanned, direct victims to a fake login page where their WhatsApp credentials are stolen.

ðŸŽ¯ Targeted Victims: The primary targets include diplomats, supporters of Ukraine, and defense officials, indicating a focus on espionage and influence operations.

ðŸ”’ Security Implications: This approach bypasses some of the usual email security measures, making it harder to detect and more effective in gaining access to personal communications.

ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º Russian Attribution: Microsoft Threat Intelligence attributes these activities to Star Blizzard, a group known for its ties to Russian state interests.
