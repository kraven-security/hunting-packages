# New Malware Campaign Spreading via Cracked Software

A fresh malware wave is targeting users with cracked software, delivering Lumma and ACR Stealer to swipe credentials and data. Stay safe—skip pirated downloads and keep your defenses up!

Key takeaways:

💾 Cracked Software Trap: Since January 2025, a campaign has spiked, using pirated software as bait to distribute Lumma and ACR Stealer malware, preying on unsuspecting downloaders.

🔐 Stealthy Theft: ACR Stealer grabs browser data, crypto wallets, and files, using clever “dead drop” tricks via Google Forms and Telegram to hide its command servers.

🕵️‍♂️ Evolving Threat: Lumma, a dark web favorite, teams up with ACR (via Hijack Loader) to harvest credentials, and AhnLab has noted a surge in this dual-infection tactic.

🛡️ Defense Call: Experts urge avoiding unofficial software sources and bolstering security to block these info-stealing threats before they strike.
