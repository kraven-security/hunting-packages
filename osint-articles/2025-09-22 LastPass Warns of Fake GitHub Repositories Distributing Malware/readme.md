Key takeaways:

🔒 SEO Poisoning: The attackers are using SEO poisoning to make their malicious GitHub pages appear high in search results, tricking users into thinking they are legitimate.

🛡️ Terminal Execution: The attack relies on social engineering, convincing users to execute a malicious command in their Terminal application to install the malware.

💡 Broad Impersonation: The campaign is impersonating a wide range of popular and trusted software, increasing the chances of tricking unsuspecting users.

🌐 Ongoing Threat: The use of public code repositories like GitHub for malware distribution is a persistent and evolving threat that requires constant vigilance.
