# Reckless and Ruthless Rabbit Scams Exploit Facebook Ads for Investment Fraud

Cybercrime groups Reckless and Ruthless Rabbit are using AI-generated deepfakes and spoofed celebrity endorsements in Facebook ads to lure victims into fake investment schemes. These scams, active since 2022, employ RDGA domains and IP filtering to target Eastern European users, stealing sensitive data and funds.

Key takeaways:

🕵️‍♂️ Sophisticated Scam Operations: Reckless and Ruthless Rabbit groups have orchestrated investment scams using AI deepfakes and fake celebrity endorsements promoted via Facebook ads, targeting Eastern Europe since 2022.

🌐 RDGA Domain Tactics: The scams leverage Randomly Generated Algorithm (RDGA) domains and cloaking tools to create short-lived phishing sites, evading detection and complicating takedowns.

📍 IP-Based Victim Filtering: Attackers use IP checks to target specific regions, redirecting non-targeted users (e.g., from the US or EU) to benign sites, enhancing campaign precision.

💳 Data and Financial Theft: Victims are lured to fraudulent trading platforms, where personal details and funds are stolen, with losses tied to fake high-return investment promises.

🛡️ Defense Recommendations: Users should verify investment ads, avoid unverified links, and employ anti-phishing tools, while platforms must strengthen ad vetting to curb malvertising.
