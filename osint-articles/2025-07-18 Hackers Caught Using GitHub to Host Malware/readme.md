# Hackers Caught Using GitHub to Host Malware

Threat actors are now leveraging public GitHub repositories to host and distribute the Amadey malware and other data stealers, a clever tactic designed to bypass web filters and make their malicious payloads appear legitimate. This campaign utilizes a malware loader called Emmenhtal to deliver the Amadey malware, which then downloads additional malicious tools from these compromised GitHub repositories.

Key takeaways:

🛡️ Trusted Platforms Abused: Cybercriminals are increasingly using trusted platforms like GitHub to host their malware, making it significantly harder for traditional security measures to detect and block them.

🌐 Sophisticated Delivery Chain: This attack demonstrates a multi-stage infection process, using one piece of malware to download another, which then fetches more malicious tools. This layered approach increases the chances of a successful infection.

🚨 Bypassing Your Defenses: By hosting malware on GitHub, attackers can often fly under the radar of standard web filtering and security solutions that are designed to block known malicious websites.

💡 Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) Ecosystem: The use of MaaS operators indicates that these malicious tools and techniques are being packaged and sold to other cybercriminals, which amplifies the threat to a much wider audience.

🔒 Evolving Threat Landscape: This is a stark reminder that threat actors are constantly refining their tactics and finding new and inventive ways to infiltrate networks and steal sensitive data.
