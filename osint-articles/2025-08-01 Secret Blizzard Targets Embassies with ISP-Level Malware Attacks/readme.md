# "Secret Blizzard" Targets Embassies with ISP-Level Malware Attacks

Russian state-sponsored hackers are using sophisticated ISP-level attacks to deploy custom malware called ApolloShadow, targeting foreign embassies in Moscow. This campaign highlights the critical need for heightened security measures for diplomatic missions.

Key takeaways:

🚨 State-Sponsored Threat: The campaign is attributed to "Secret Blizzard" (aka Turla), a group linked to Russia's Federal Security Service.

🌐 ISP-Level Attack: Attackers are leveraging their position within ISPs to conduct Adversary-in-the-Middle (AitM) attacks.

🔒 Custom Malware: A new malware strain, "ApolloShadow," is being deployed to install root certificates and gain administrative privileges.

🛡️ Deceptive Tactics: The malware installation is sometimes disguised as a legitimate Kaspersky antivirus certificate.

💡 Actionable Defense: Organizations, especially diplomatic entities, should implement the Principle of Least Privilege, use encrypted tunnels, and mandate VPN use to mitigate this threat.
