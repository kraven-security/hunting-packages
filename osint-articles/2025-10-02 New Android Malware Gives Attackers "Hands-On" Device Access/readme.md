# New Android Malware Gives Attackers "Hands-On" Device Access

A new Android banking trojan, "Klopatra," is giving attackers unprecedented, real-time control over infected devices. The malware, disguised as a legitimate IPTV and VPN app, allows for on-screen monitoring, input capture, and even remote control while the device appears to be locked.

Key takeaways:

🔒 Hidden VNC Control: Klopatra's most dangerous feature is a hidden VNC mode that allows attackers to secretly control the device, even when the screen is off.

🛡️ Advanced Evasion: The malware uses a variety of techniques to avoid detection, including code protection and attempts to uninstall popular antivirus apps.

💡 Side-Loading is the Risk: The malware is distributed outside of the official Google Play Store, highlighting the dangers of installing apps from untrusted sources.

🌐 Active and Evolving Threat: The trojan is under active development, with new versions being released frequently, indicating a persistent and evolving threat.
