# EDDIESTEALER Malware Exploits ClickFix to Steal Sensitive Browser Data

A new Rust-based malware, EDDIESTEALER, is spreading via fake CAPTCHA pages using the ClickFix tactic to trick users into running malicious PowerShell scripts. It bypasses Chrome‚Äôs encryption to steal credentials, browser data, and crypto wallet details.

Key takeaways:

üïµÔ∏è Sophisticated Delivery: EDDIESTEALER leverages the ClickFix social engineering tactic, using fake CAPTCHA pages on compromised websites to deceive users into executing malicious PowerShell scripts, initiating the infection chain.

üîí Bypassing Security: Written in Rust, the malware employs obfuscation techniques such as XOR encryption and symbol stripping, and bypasses Chrome‚Äôs app-bound encryption to steal sensitive data, including cookies, passwords, and cryptocurrency wallet details.

üíª Cross-Platform Threat: The campaign targets multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Android, iOS) using tailored attack chains, including browser redirections and drive-by downloads, to deploy EDDIESTEALER and other malware, such as Atomic macOS Stealer.

üõ°Ô∏è Evasion Techniques: EDDIESTEALER uses anti-sandbox checks, self-deletion via NTFS Alternate Data Streams, and dynamic command-and-control (C2) tasking to evade detection and adapt its behavior, making it a stealthy threat.

üö® Wider Context: This campaign aligns with Operation Endgame, which disrupted similar malware operations, highlighting the growing use of ClickFix by both cybercriminals and state-sponsored actors to distribute infostealers.
