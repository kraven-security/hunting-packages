# Hackers Exploit Unpatched Gogs Zero-Day to Breach 700+ Servers

Attackers are actively exploiting an unpatched remote code execution (RCE) zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-8110) in Gogs, a popular self-hosted Git service, compromising hundreds of Internet-facing servers. The flaw allows threat actors to bypass previous security patches using symbolic links to overwrite system files and execute arbitrary commands.

Key takeaways:

🔓 Zero-Day Exploit: The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-8110, is a path traversal weakness in the PutContents API that bypasses protections for a previous RCE bug (CVE-2024-55947).

🌍 Widespread Impact: Researchers have identified over 1,400 exposed Gogs servers, with more than 700 already showing signs of compromise, such as random 8-character repository names.

🤖 Automated Attacks: The campaign appears to be driven by a single actor using automated tools to deploy malware based on the Supershell C2 framework.

🛠️ No Patch Yet: Gogs maintainers acknowledged the flaw in late October but a patch is still in development; a second wave of attacks began in November.

🛡️ Mitigation Now: Admins should immediately disable "Open Registration," restrict server access via VPN or allow lists, and scan for suspicious API activity.
