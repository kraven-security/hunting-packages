# Malware Campaign Abuses Cloudflare Tunnels for Stealthy Attacks

A sophisticated malware campaign, dubbed SERPENTINE#CLOUD, is exploiting Cloudflare's infrastructure to deliver Remote Access Trojans (RATs) through deceptive phishing emails. This tactic allows attackers to evade detection by blending malicious traffic with legitimate Cloudflare services.

Key takeaways: 

🚨 Cloudflare as a Weapon: Threat actors are using Cloudflare Tunnel subdomains to host and deliver malware, making it difficult for security tools to distinguish malicious activity from benign traffic.

🎣 Phishing Vector: The attack begins with phishing emails containing zipped documents. Inside the zip is a Windows shortcut (.lnk) file that, when opened, triggers a multi-stage infection process.

🐍 In-Memory Payload: The campaign utilizes a Python-based loader to deploy payloads such as AsyncRAT and Revenge RAT entirely in memory, a technique designed to bypass traditional antivirus and endpoint detection solutions.

🌐 Global Targets: This campaign has been observed targeting victims across the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and other parts of Europe and Asia.

🛡️ Enhanced Vigilance: Users should exercise extreme caution with unexpected emails, especially those containing attachments such as zip files, and verify the sender's identity before clicking on any links or opening files.
