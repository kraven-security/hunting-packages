# ResolverRAT Malware Targets Global Pharma and Healthcare with Stealthy Phishing Attacks

A new ResolverRAT malware campaign is targeting pharmaceutical and healthcare organizations worldwide. It uses sneaky phishing and in-memory execution to steal data. Morphisec warns that its advanced evasion tactics make it a tough threat to detect and stop.

Key takeaways:

🦠 Stealthy Execution: ResolverRAT operates entirely in memory, abusing .NET 'ResourceResolve' events to load malicious code without suspicious API calls, evading traditional security tools.

🎣 Phishing Delivery: The malware spreads via localized phishing emails, sharing infrastructure with Rhadamanthys and Lumma stealers, targeting regions like India, Italy, and Turkey.

🔒 Complex Evasion: It uses a state machine to obscure control flow, detects sandboxes, and employs XOR-obfuscated Registry keys for persistence across up to 20 locations.

🌐 Global Impact: Observed as recently as March 10, 2025, ResolverRAT’s advanced C2 infrastructure ensures secure data exfiltration, breaking large files into 16 KB chunks to avoid detection.
