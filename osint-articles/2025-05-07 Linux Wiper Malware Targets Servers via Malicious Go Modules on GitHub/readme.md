# Linux Wiper Malware Targets Servers via Malicious Go Modules on GitHub

A supply-chain attack has deployed disk-wiping malware hidden in three Golang modules on GitHub, targeting Linux servers with obfuscated code that erases critical data. Detected in April 2025, this campaign underscores the growing threat to open-source ecosystems, urging developers to verify package authenticity.

Key takeaways:

🕵️‍♂️ Supply-Chain Attack Uncovered: Three malicious Go modules on GitHub, detected in April 2025, contained hidden disk-wiping malware targeting Linux servers, posing a severe threat to system integrity.

💾 Destructive Payload: The modules used obfuscated code to download scripts via ‘wget’, executing commands that overwrite /dev/sda, rendering Linux systems unbootable.

🌐 GitHub as Attack Vector: Hosted on GitHub, the modules masqueraded as legitimate tools, exploiting trust in the platform to deliver payloads, with repositories now removed.

🔍 Broader Ecosystem Risks: Similar attacks on npm and PyPI, targeting cryptocurrency wallets, highlight vulnerabilities in open-source repositories, necessitating rigorous dependency audits.

🛡️ Mitigation Strategies: Developers should verify package publishers, audit dependencies, enforce strict access controls, and use security tools to detect malicious code.
