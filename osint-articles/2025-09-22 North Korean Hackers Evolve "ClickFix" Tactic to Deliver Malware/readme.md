# North Korean Hackers Evolve "ClickFix" Tactic to Deliver Malware

North Korean-backed hacking groups are expanding their targets and refining their techniques, using an evolved social engineering tactic dubbed "ClickFix" to deliver a range of malware. These campaigns, no longer limited to software developers, are now targeting cryptocurrency and retail sectors.

Key takeaways:

🔒 Expanded Targeting: The threat has moved beyond developers to include marketing and trading roles, indicating a broader and more financially motivated strategy.

🛡️ Sophisticated Social Engineering: The "ClickFix" tactic tricks users into running malicious code through seemingly legitimate troubleshooting steps, often disguised as job assessments.

💡 New Malware Strains: The attackers are deploying new and updated malware, including BeaverTail, GolangGhost, and FlexibleFerret, across Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.

🌐 Abuse of Trusted Platforms: The Kimsuky group is leveraging GitHub for malware delivery and data exfiltration, and even using OpenAI's ChatGPT to create deepfake IDs for phishing campaigns.
