# SystemBC Malware Hijacks VPS Systems for Malicious Proxies

The SystemBC proxy botnet is actively compromising vulnerable commercial virtual private servers (VPS) and turning them into a massive network for routing malicious traffic. This botnet, which maintains an average of 1,500 active bots daily, is being used to fuel other criminal proxy services and facilitate attacks like brute-forcing WordPress credentials.

Key takeaways:

🔒 Vulnerable Servers Targeted: The attackers are specifically targeting commercial VPS systems with unpatched vulnerabilities, with infected servers having an average of 20 unpatched security issues.

🛡️ High-Volume Traffic: The compromised servers are being used to generate a high volume of malicious traffic, with one observed IP address generating over 16 gigabytes of proxy data in a single day.

💡 Long-Term Infections: A significant number of compromised systems (nearly 40%) remain infected for over a month, indicating a lack of detection and remediation.

🌐 Powering Other Criminal Services: The SystemBC network is being used to power other criminal proxy services, including REM Proxy and VN5Socks, expanding the reach and impact of their malicious activities.
