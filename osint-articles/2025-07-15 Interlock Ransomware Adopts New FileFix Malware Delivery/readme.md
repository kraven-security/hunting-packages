# Interlock Ransomware Adopts New "FileFix" Malware Delivery

The Interlock ransomware group is now using an evolved social engineering technique called "FileFix" to deliver a new PHP-based remote access trojan (RAT). This method, a variation of the "ClickFix" technique, tricks users into pasting a malicious file path into Windows File Explorer to compromise their systems.

Key takeaways:

🚨 New Delivery Method: Interlock is using "FileFix," a social engineering technique that manipulates users into executing malicious scripts by pasting file paths into File Explorer.

🛡️ Evasive Malware: The new RAT is PHP-based, a shift from their previous JavaScript-based "NodeSnake" RAT, and is designed to be more resilient and evasive.

💡 Social Engineering: The attack relies on tricking users with fake CAPTCHA or verification messages, convincing them to run malicious code themselves.

🌐 Widespread Campaign: This new campaign is targeting a broad range of industries, using compromised websites to initiate the attack chain.

🔒 Double Extortion: Interlock continues to use double-extortion tactics, encrypting data and threatening to publish it to pressure victims into paying.
