# Malvertising Scam Exploits Google Ads to Hijack Advertiser Accounts

Cybercriminals are using fake Google Ads to steal advertiser credentials. This sophisticated malvertising campaign could lead to significant financial losses by redirecting users to phishing sites mimicking Google Ads login pages.

Key takeaways:

🕵️ Sophisticated Malvertising: A scam has been uncovered where attackers use fake Google Ads to deceive users into providing sensitive credentials, including login information and 2FA codes.

🔗 Phishing Redirection: The campaign redirects victims to fraudulent login pages that closely mimic the real Google Ads interfaces, aiming to capture credentials.

💳 Financial Implications: Once compromised, these accounts can be used to misuse advertising budgets for further malicious campaigns or sold on black markets.

🌍 Geographically Indiscriminate: The scam doesn't target specific regions but uses the .pt TLD, suggesting possible origins or operations from Portugal or Brazil.

🛡️ Google's Response: Google has been actively removing ads reported by researchers, but the attackers quickly adapt, showing the challenge of completely eradicating such malvertising.
