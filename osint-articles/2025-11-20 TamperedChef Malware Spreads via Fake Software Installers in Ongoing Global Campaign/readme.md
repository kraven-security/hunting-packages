# TamperedChef Malware Spreads via Fake Software Installers in Ongoing Global Campaign

Hackers are leveraging bogus installers for popular utilities, such as "AppSuite PDF Editor," to distribute the sophisticated TamperedChef malware via malvertising and SEO poisoning. The malware lies dormant for weeks to evade detection before activating to steal browser credentials and establish remote persistence.

Key takeaways:

🕵️‍♂️ Deceptive Distribution: Attackers use "industrialized" infrastructure to churn out fake installers signed with valid digital certificates from shell companies, distributing them via Google Ads and poisoned search results.

⏳ Strategic Dormancy: TamperedChef often remains dormant for up to 56 days—aligning with ad campaign lifecycles—to bypass sandbox analysis and behavioral monitoring before executing its payload.

🦠 Malicious Payload: Once activated, the malware (also known as BaoLoader) harvests sensitive data, including browser cookies and credentials, and establishes a JavaScript backdoor for long-term access.

🔍 Global Impact: The campaign targets users worldwide, with specific confirmed infections in European organizations, utilizing social engineering to trick victims into accepting fake EULAs.

🛡️ Mitigation Advice: Organizations should enforce strict application allowlisting, monitor for unusual scheduled tasks (like PDFEditorUpdater), and educate users on the risks of downloading software from sponsored search results.
