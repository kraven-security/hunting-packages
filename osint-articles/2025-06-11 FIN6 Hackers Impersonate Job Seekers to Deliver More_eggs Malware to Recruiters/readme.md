# FIN6 Hackers Impersonate Job Seekers to Deliver More_eggs Malware to Recruiters

FIN6 hackers are posing as job seekers on LinkedIn and Indeed, using fake AWS-hosted resumes to trick recruiters into downloading the More_eggs malware. This social engineering attack aims to steal credentials and deploy ransomware, urging HR to verify external links cautiously.

Key takeaways:

🕵️‍♂️ Social Engineering Tactic: FIN6, a financially motivated hacking group, impersonates job seekers on platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, building rapport with recruiters to share phishing links disguised as resumes hosted on AWS infrastructure.

🦠 More_eggs Malware: The campaign delivers the More_eggs JavaScript backdoor, a modular malware-as-a-service capable of credential theft, system access, and ransomware deployment, using domains like bobbyweisman[.]com and ryanberardi[.]com.

🛡️ Deceptive Delivery: Victims encounter a fake CAPTCHA before downloading a ZIP file containing a malicious Windows shortcut (LNK) that executes a script to install the backdoor, bypassing security tools due to trusted AWS hosting.

🔍 Advanced Evasion: The attack leverages anonymously registered GoDaddy domains and AWS’s trusted cloud to evade detection, with only qualified targets receiving the malicious payload to avoid scanners and VPNs.

🔒 Mitigation Advice: Recruiters and HR professionals are advised to verify external resume links carefully and implement robust security measures to detect and block such sophisticated phishing attempts.
