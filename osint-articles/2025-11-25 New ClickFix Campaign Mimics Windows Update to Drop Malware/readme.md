# New ClickFix Campaign Mimics Windows Update to Drop Malware

A sophisticated new ClickFix campaign is tricking users with highly realistic fake Windows Update screens that lead to severe malware infections. Victims are socially engineered into manually executing malicious PowerShell commands, often unleashing stealthy info-stealers hidden within image files.

Key takeaways:

🛑 The Lure: Attackers display a convincing full-screen fake Windows Update animation that claims to be "fixing" an issue.

🎣 The Trap: The site instructs victims to press specific keys (often Win + R, then Ctrl + V) to paste and run a malicious command to "complete" the update.

🖼️ Steganography: To evade antivirus detection, the malicious code is often hidden inside the pixel data of PNG images.

🦠 The Payload: This campaign primarily distributes info-stealers like Lumma and Rhadamanthys, which harvest credentials and cryptocurrency wallets.

🛡️ Defense: Legitimate Windows Updates will never ask you to run a command in the Run dialog or PowerShell manually.
