# Gremlin Stealer: New C# Malware Targets Sensitive Data via Telegram Sales

Gremlin Stealer, a new C# malware sold on Telegram since March 2025, steals credit cards, crypto wallets, and browser data and uploads it to a public server. Unit 42 reports its active development and widespread threat to Windows users.

Key takeaways:

🕵️‍♂️ Gremlin Stealer, written in C#, emerged in March 2025. It was advertised on Telegram’s CoderSharp channel and targeted Windows systems to steal browser cookies, credit card details, crypto wallets, and Discord/Telegram sessions.

🌐 Stolen data is stored in plain text under LOCAL_APP_DATA, zipped, and sent to a server at 207.244.199[.]46, which hosts 14 ZIP archives for download or deletion, enhancing attacker accessibility.

🔍 The malware bypasses Chrome’s V20 cookie protection and avoids internet downloads during its build, showing active development to evade detection. A configurable portal is included in the sale.

⚠️ Palo Alto Networks’ Cortex XDR and Network Security solutions protect against Gremlin, while Unit 42 shared findings with the Cyber Threat Alliance to disrupt its spread.
