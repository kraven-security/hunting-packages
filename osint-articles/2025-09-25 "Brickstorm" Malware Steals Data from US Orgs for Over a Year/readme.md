# "Brickstorm" Malware Steals Data from US Orgs for Over a Year

Suspected Chinese state-sponsored hackers have been using a sophisticated Go-based backdoor, dubbed "Brickstorm," in a long-running espionage campaign targeting U.S. organizations. The malware, which has been active for over a year, has been used to steal sensitive data from companies in the tech, legal, and SaaS sectors.

Key takeaways:

🔒 Long Dwell Time: The attackers remained undetected in victim networks for an average of 393 days, allowing for extensive data exfiltration.

🛡️ Stealthy Operations: The threat actors used advanced techniques to evade detection, including masquerading their command-and-control traffic as legitimate services like Cloudflare and Heroku.

💡 Focus on High-Value Targets: The campaign specifically targeted developers, administrators, and individuals with access to sensitive information.

🌐 Evolving Threat Landscape: The use of custom malware, zero-day exploits, and sophisticated evasion techniques highlights the ever-evolving nature of cyber threats.
