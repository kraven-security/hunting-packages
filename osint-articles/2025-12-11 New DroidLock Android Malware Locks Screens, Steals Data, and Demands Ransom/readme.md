# New DroidLock Android Malware Locks Screens, Steals Data, and Demands Ransom

A dangerous new Android malware strain called DroidLock has been discovered targeting users with screen-locking ransomware tactics and advanced data theft capabilities. Discovered by Zimperium, this threat exploits accessibility permissions to not only hold devices hostage but also gain full remote control over them.

Key takeaways:

🔒 Screen Locker: DroidLock functions primarily as a screen locker, freezing your device with an overlay that demands payment via a Proton email address to avoid "data destruction."

🕵️ Data Espionage: Unlike simple lockers, DroidLock is a powerful spy tool capable of harvesting SMS messages, call logs, contacts, and even recording audio from the device.

📱 Total Remote Control: The malware includes VNC (Virtual Network Computing) capabilities, allowing attackers to remotely view and control the victim's screen in real-time.

⚠️ Permission Abuse: To operate, DroidLock tricks users into granting "Accessibility Services" and "Device Admin" rights, which it then abuses to change PINs, factory reset phones, or uninstall other apps.

🛡️ Stay Protected: Google Play Protect has been updated to detect DroidLock. Users are urged to avoid side-loading apps from third-party sites and to strictly review app permissions.
