# "GlassWorm" Malware Spreading Through VS Code & OpenVSX!

A new, sophisticated self-spreading malware called "GlassWorm" is targeting developers through the VS Code and OpenVSX marketplaces. This worm-like supply-chain attack has already resulted in over 35,800 installations, using invisible Unicode characters to hide its malicious code and automatically spreading to other extensions by stealing developer credentials.

Key takeaways:

🔒 Self-Spreading: The worm steals GitHub, npm, and OpenVSX credentials to infect other extensions published by the victim. 

🛡️ Stealthy Attack: Malicious code is hidden using "invisible Unicode characters" to evade detection. 

💡 Auto-Update Risk: The automatic update feature in VS Code silently infected all users of a compromised extension without any warning. 

🌐 Resilient C2: The malware uses the Solana blockchain for its command-and-control, making it extremely difficult to take down.
