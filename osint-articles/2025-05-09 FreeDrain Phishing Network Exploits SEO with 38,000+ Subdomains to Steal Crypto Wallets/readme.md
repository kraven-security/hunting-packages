# FreeDrain Phishing Network Exploits SEO with 38,000+ Subdomains to Steal Crypto Wallets

FreeDrain, a massive phishing operation, has used 38,000+ subdomains to manipulate SEO and steal crypto wallet seed phrases since 2022, costing victims millions. The campaign uses free-tier platforms like GitHub and Webflow to avoid detection, urging users to verify wallet-related search results.

Key takeaways:

🕵️‍♂️ Industrial-Scale Phishing: FreeDrain has operated since 2022, using 38,000+ subdomains across free-tier platforms like gitbook.io and github.io to host phishing pages that steal cryptocurrency wallet seed phrases.

🌐 SEO Manipulation: The campaign exploits search engine optimization with spamdexing and layered redirects, tricking users searching wallet-related queries into visiting fake wallet interfaces hosted on cloud services like Amazon S3.

💻 Resilient Infrastructure: By abusing legitimate services for hosting and redirection, FreeDrain creates a hard-to-disrupt network that rapidly rebuilds after takedowns. Its operations are linked to individuals in the Indian Standard Time zone.

💰 Significant Losses: FreeDrain’s tactics, alongside a related Inferno Drainer campaign costing $9 million, highlight the financial impact. Phishing pages mimicked trusted brands like MetaMask and Coinbase.

🛡️ Defense Recommendations: Users should verify search result legitimacy, avoid untrusted links, and use anti-phishing tools, while platforms must enhance abuse detection to curb such scalable phishing networks.
