# "ToolShell" Zero-Day Actively Exploiting On-Prem SharePoint Servers Globally

A widespread attack campaign is exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability chain (dubbed "ToolShell") in on-prem Microsoft SharePoint. Attackers are gaining unauthenticated remote code execution to steal cryptographic keys, deploy ransomware, and maintain persistent access.

Key takeaways:

🌐 Global Campaign: The attack targets government, defense, and critical infrastructure organizations across at least four continents.

🛡️ Stealthy Persistence: Attackers are stealing ASP.NET machine keys. This allows them to forge credentials and maintain access even after servers have been patched.

🦠 Payloads: Active post-exploitation includes data exfiltration, webshells (spinstall0.aspx), and the deployment of ransomware.

🔒 Action: Patching Is Not Enough: Admins MUST apply the latest Microsoft updates, immediately rotate all SharePoint ASP.NET machine keys, and then restart IIS to fully remediate.

💡 Hunt for Compromise: Immediately scan for IoCs, including suspicious POST requests to ToolPane.aspx and newly created .aspx files in server directories.
