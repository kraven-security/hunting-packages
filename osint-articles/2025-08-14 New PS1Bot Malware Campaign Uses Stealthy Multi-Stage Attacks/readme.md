# New PS1Bot Malware Campaign Uses Stealthy Multi-Stage Attacks

A new malvertising campaign is distributing the PS1Bot malware, a modular framework designed for stealth and in-memory execution. The campaign, active since early 2025, uses multi-stage attacks to compromise systems and has technical similarities to the AHK Bot used by known threat actors.

Key takeaways:

🔒 Stealthy by Design: PS1Bot minimizes its footprint on infected systems by executing modules in-memory, making it harder to detect and analyze.

🚨 Malvertising and SEO Poisoning: The initial infection vector relies on tricking users into downloading a compressed archive containing a malicious JavaScript payload.

💡 Multi-Stage Attack: The attack chain involves multiple steps, starting with a JavaScript downloader, followed by a PowerShell script that communicates with a C2 server to download and execute various malicious modules.

🛡️ Data Theft and Espionage: PS1Bot's modules are capable of a wide range of malicious activities, including detecting antivirus software, capturing screenshots, stealing data from browsers and crypto wallets, logging keystrokes, and gathering system information.

🌐 Links to Known Threat Actors: The malware shares technical similarities with tools used by established threat actor groups like Asylum Ambuscade and TA866, suggesting a sophisticated adversary.
