# New Aquabotv3 Botnet Malware Targets Mitel Command Injection Vulnerability

The recently identified Aquabotv3 botnet is exploiting a command injection flaw in Mitel SIP phones (CVE-2024-41710) to expand its network for DDoS attacks. This Mirai-based threat introduces novel features, including reporting kill signals back to its C2 server.

Key takeaways:

🚨 Aquabotv3 Threat: A new variant of Mirai-based botnet, Aquabotv3, is targeting a known vulnerability in Mitel SIP phones to compromise devices.

🔓 Vulnerability Exploited: It leverages CVE-2024-41710, a command injection vulnerability during the phone's boot process, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands.

🌐 DDoS Capabilities: Once infected, devices join the botnet, which is used to conduct distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

📡 Unique Feature: Aquabotv3 has a mechanism to report kill attempts to its command-and-control (C2) server, a rare trait among botnets. This aids in monitoring and persistence.

🛡️ Security Measures: Users are advised to update to the latest Mitel firmware or isolate affected devices to prevent exploitation and participation in DDoS activities.
