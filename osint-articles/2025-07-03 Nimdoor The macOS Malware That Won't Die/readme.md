A new macOS malware strain, "Nimdoor," is targeting cryptocurrency users with a novel trick: it revives itself even after being terminated. Attributed to North Korean state-sponsored hackers, this malware is designed to steal sensitive data from your system.

Key takeaways:

üö® Self-Reviving Malware: Nimdoor employs a unique persistence mechanism that enables it to restart automatically if the process is terminated.

üí∞ Crypto-Focused Theft: The primary goal of this malware is to steal data related to cryptocurrency, targeting browser information, Keychain access, and even your Telegram database.

üíª Uncommon Tactics: The malware is built using the Nim programming language, a less common choice for macOS threats, making it harder for some security tools to detect.

üé£ Social Engineering: The initial infection vector relies on social engineering, tricking users into downloading fake updates or software.

üõ°Ô∏è Stay Vigilant: This evolving threat underscores the importance for macOS users, particularly those in the web3 and crypto space, to exercise extra caution when downloading and to utilize robust security software.
