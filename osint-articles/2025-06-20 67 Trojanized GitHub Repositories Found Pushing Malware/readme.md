# 67 Trojanized GitHub Repositories Found Pushing Malware

A new campaign dubbed "Banana Squad" has been found using over 67 trojanized GitHub repositories to deliver malicious Python payloads, often disguised as legitimate tools like game cheats and account cleaners.

Key takeaways:

🚨 Widespread Campaign: Researchers uncovered a significant operation involving dozens of malicious repositories targeting developers and other GitHub users.

👨‍💻 Deceptive Tactics: Threat actors impersonate benign software and use fake stars and frequent updates to boost the popularity and search ranking of their malicious repositories.

📈 Multi-Stage Attacks: These campaigns often involve multi-stage malware, with some even targeting novice cybercriminals by backdooring their own attack tools.

🛡️ Vigilance is Key: Developers and users are urged to double-check the contents of repositories and be cautious of those with unusually high popularity, especially for tools related to gaming or hacking.

🌐 Growing Threat: The use of platforms like GitHub as a malware distribution vector is on the rise, highlighting the need for robust security practices to defend against supply chain attacks.
