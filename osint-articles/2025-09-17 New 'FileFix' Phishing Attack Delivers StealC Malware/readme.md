# New 'FileFix' Phishing Attack Delivers StealC Malware

A sophisticated phishing campaign is using a novel "FileFix" tactic to trick users into downloading the StealC information-stealing malware. The attack uses a convincing, multilingual fake Facebook Security page to lure victims into executing malicious code.

Key takeaways:

🔒 Deceptive Social Engineering: The "FileFix" method tricks users into pasting a malicious command into their File Explorer address bar, a clever evolution of the "ClickFix" tactic.

🛡️ Convincing Phishing Site: The attack leverages a highly realistic, multilingual phishing page that creates a false sense of urgency by threatening account suspension.

💡 Multi-Stage Payload: The malware is delivered in stages, starting with a PowerShell script that downloads seemingly harmless images containing the malicious code.

🌐 Evasive Maneuvers: Attackers are using legitimate services like Bitbucket to host malware and employ advanced obfuscation techniques to evade detection.
