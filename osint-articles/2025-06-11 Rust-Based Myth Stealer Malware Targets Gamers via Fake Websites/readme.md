🗞️ Rust-Based Myth Stealer Malware Targets Gamers via Fake Websites

The Rust-based Myth Stealer malware is spreading through fake gaming sites, tricking users with decoy windows while stealing browser data like passwords and cookies. Initially free on Telegram, it’s now a subscription-based threat targeting Chrome, Firefox, and other browsers.

Key takeaways:

🕵️‍♂️ Deceptive Distribution: Myth Stealer, a Rust-based infostealer, spreads via fraudulent gaming websites and cracked game cheat software, using fake setup windows to mask malicious code execution.

🦠 Data Theft Capabilities: The malware targets Chromium- and Gecko-based browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Firefox), stealing passwords, cookies, and autofill data, with the exfiltrated data being sent to remote servers or Discord webhooks.

💰 Malware-as-a-Service: Initially offered for free on Telegram in December 2024, Myth Stealer now operates on a subscription-based model, with operators maintaining channels for updates and selling compromised accounts.

🛡️ Evolving Threat: The malware utilizes XOR or AES encryption for its stealer component and regularly updates to evade antivirus detection, incorporating features such as screen capture and clipboard hijacking.

🔒 Mitigation Urgency: Users should avoid unverified gaming sites and cracked software, while organizations need robust endpoint security to detect and block this stealthy Rust-based threat.
