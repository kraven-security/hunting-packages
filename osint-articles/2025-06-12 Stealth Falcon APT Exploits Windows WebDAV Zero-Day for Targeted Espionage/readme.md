# Stealth Falcon APT Exploits Windows WebDAV Zero-Day for Targeted Espionage

Stealth Falcon hackers exploited a Windows WebDAV zero-day (CVE-2025-33053) to deploy advanced Horus malware in espionage attacks targeting defense and government entities in the Middle East and Africa. Microsoft patched the flaw in June 2025's Patch Tuesday—update now to block stealthy malware delivery.

Key takeaways:

🕵️‍♂️ Zero-Day Exploitation: The Stealth Falcon APT group, active since 2012, used a Windows WebDAV remote code execution flaw (CVE-2025-33053) to execute malware from attacker-controlled servers, discovered by Check Point Research and patched by Microsoft in June 2025.

🎯 Targeted Espionage: The group has targeted defense and government organizations in Turkey, Qatar, Egypt, and Yemen since March 2025, using spear-phishing with .url files to exploit vulnerabilities for stealthy code execution.

🛠️ Horus Malware Suite: Post-exploitation tools included the Horus Loader and Agent, a credential dumper, keylogger, and a passive backdoor for encrypted shellcode, designed for espionage with high stealth and modularity.

🔍 Sophisticated Tactics: The attack leveraged legitimate Windows tools and commercial obfuscation to evade detection, manipulating WebDAV paths to run malicious executables without local file drops.

🔒 Patch and Mitigation: Microsoft’s patch adds vulnerable module hashes to the DBX, and organizations are urged to apply updates immediately to prevent further exploitation by this nation-state-linked group.
