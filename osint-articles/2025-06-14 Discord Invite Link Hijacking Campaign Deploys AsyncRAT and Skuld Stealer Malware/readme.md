# Discord Invite Link Hijacking Campaign Deploys AsyncRAT and Skuld Stealer Malware

Hackers are exploiting Discord’s invite system, hijacking expired links to lure users to malicious servers that deliver AsyncRAT and Skuld Stealer, targeting cryptocurrency wallets. Check Point Research warns of this sophisticated phishing attack using ClickFix tactics—stay cautious with Discord invites! 

Key takeaways: 

🕵️‍♂️ Hijacked Invite Links: Attackers exploit Discord’s flawed invite system, reusing expired or deleted vanity links to redirect users from trusted sources to malicious servers, leveraging the platform’s Level 3 Boost feature for custom URLs.

🦠 Malware Delivery: The campaign employs the ClickFix phishing technique, deceiving users into running PowerShell scripts via fake verification prompts, thereby deploying AsyncRAT for remote control and Skuld Stealer to target cryptocurrency wallets.

🛠️ Multi-Stage Infection: The attack chain utilizes trusted cloud services, such as GitHub, Bitbucket, and Pastebin, for payload delivery and data exfiltration, incorporating time-based evasions to bypass antivirus detection.

🔍 Global Impact: Over 1,300 downloads of malicious payloads were recorded, affecting users worldwide, particularly crypto enthusiasts, as attackers continually update their tools to maintain stealth.

🔒 Mitigation Advice: Users should verify Discord invite links, avoid suspicious verification prompts, and use permanent invites. Although Discord has disabled the specific bot, the core flaw persists.
