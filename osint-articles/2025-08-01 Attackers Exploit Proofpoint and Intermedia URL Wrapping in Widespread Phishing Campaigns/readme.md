# Attackers Exploit Proofpoint and Intermedia URL Wrapping in Widespread Phishing Campaigns

Attackers are exploiting URL wrapping features from trusted security vendors like Proofpoint and Intermedia to launch sophisticated phishing attacks. This method bypasses standard security checks to steal your credentials.

Key takeaways:

🚨 Abused Trust: Threat actors are weaponizing the very tools meant to protect you, using the reputation of security link-wrapping services to conceal malicious URLs.

🌐 Targeted Attacks: The campaign primarily focuses on harvesting Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace credentials, putting your corporate data at significant risk.

🔒 Evasion Tactics: Attackers are using techniques like CAPTCHA challenges on their phishing pages to block automated URL analysis and sandboxing, making detection harder.

🛡️ Vigilance is Key: Don't blindly trust a link just because a known security service wraps it. Always hover over links to inspect the true destination URL before clicking.

💡 Layered Defense: This highlights the need for a multi-layered security approach. Relying on a single solution is no longer enough to defend against evolving phishing tactics.
