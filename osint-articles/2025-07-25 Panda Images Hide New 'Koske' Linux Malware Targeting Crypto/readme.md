# Panda Images Hide New 'Koske' Linux Malware Targeting Crypto

A sophisticated new Linux malware, "Koske," is being delivered through seemingly harmless panda JPEG images to install cryptocurrency miners. The attack uses advanced techniques like in-memory execution to evade detection, primarily exploiting misconfigured JupyterLab instances to gain initial access.

Key takeaways:

🐼 Stealthy Delivery: The malware is hidden within polyglot files that function as both JPEG images and shell scripts, making initial detection difficult.

💻 In-Memory Execution: Koske's payloads run directly in the system's memory, leaving minimal on-disk footprint and bypassing many traditional security tools.

🔬 JupyterLab Exploitation: Attackers gain their initial foothold by targeting publicly exposed and misconfigured JupyterLab notebooks.

🛡️ Dual-Payload Attack: The malware deploys a rootkit to hide its malicious processes and files, while a separate shell script ensures persistence and downloads various cryptominers.

💰 Cryptocurrency Mining: The ultimate objective is to leverage the compromised system's resources to mine for more than 18 different cryptocurrencies, including Monero and Ravencoin.
