# SuperBlack Ransomware Exploits Fortinet Auth Bypass Flaws in Targeted Attacks

The new SuperBlack ransomware is exploiting Fortinet auth bypass flaws (CVE-2025-24472) to hit unpatched firewalls, with Forescout linking it to LockBit tactics. Over 23K vulnerable devices remain exposed globally. Patch your systems now to avoid this growing threat!

Key takeaways:

🕵️‍♂️ New Ransomware Emerges: A threat actor dubbed Mora_001 is deploying SuperBlack ransomware by exploiting Fortinet vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-24472), targeting unpatched FortiOS/FortiProxy devices since February 2025.

🔓 Auth Bypass Exploit: Attackers gain super-admin access using WebSocket attacks or HTTPS requests, deploying ransomware and a WipeBlack wiper to erase traces and hinder forensics.

🔗 LockBit Ties: Forescout researchers found strong links to LockBit, including IP overlaps and a shared TOX chat ID in ransom notes, suggesting Mora_001 may be a former affiliate.

🌍 Global Exposure: Over 23K Fortinet devices remain vulnerable worldwide, with 1K+ in Japan alone, despite patches being available since January 2024.

🛡️ Patch Urgency: Admins must apply updates, disable exposed interfaces, or restrict access to mitigate this risk—don’t wait for SuperBlack to strike!
