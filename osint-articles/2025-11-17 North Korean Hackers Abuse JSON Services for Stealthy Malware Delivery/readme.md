# North Korean Hackers Abuse JSON Services for Stealthy Malware Delivery

North Korean threat actors behind the "Contagious Interview" campaign have evolved their tactics, now leveraging legitimate JSON storage services, such as JSON Keeper and npoint.io, to conceal and deliver malicious payloads. By embedding obfuscated URLs within fake "API keys" in trojanized code projects, they effectively bypass traditional detection methods to target developers.

Key takeaways:

🕵️‍♂️ New Delivery Vector: Hackers are using services like JSON Keeper, JSONsilo, and npoint.io to host obfuscated malware payloads, blending in with normal traffic.

💼 Job Interview Lure: The campaign targets developers on LinkedIn with fake job offers or collaboration requests, tricking them into downloading compromised projects from GitHub or GitLab.

🦠 BeaverTail & InvisibleFerret: The attacks deploy the "BeaverTail" JavaScript malware to harvest data, followed by the "InvisibleFerret" Python backdoor for persistent access.

🧩 TsunamiKit Payload: Recent updates include fetching "TsunamiKit," a toolkit for system fingerprinting and further payload retrieval, adding a new layer of sophistication.

⚠️ Developer Alert: Users should scrutinize "demo projects" for hidden configuration files (like .config.env) containing suspicious Base64-encoded strings acting as fake API keys.
