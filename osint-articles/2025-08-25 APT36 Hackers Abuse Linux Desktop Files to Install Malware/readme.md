# APT36 Hackers Abuse Linux Desktop Files to Install Malware

Pakistani APT group, APT36, is exploiting Linux .desktop files in a new wave of attacks to deploy espionage malware. The group is using phishing emails with ZIP archives containing malicious .desktop files disguised as PDF documents to lure their victims.

Key takeaways:

🔒 APT36 is using a novel technique to bypass security measures by embedding malicious commands within .desktop files.

🚨 The malware is a Go-based ELF executable designed for espionage, which allows attackers to exfiltrate data and execute remote commands.

💡 The attackers use social engineering tactics, disguising the malicious files as legitimate documents to trick users into opening them.

🛡️ To protect against this threat, users should be cautious of unsolicited emails with attachments, especially those that ask to open files with unusual extensions. It is also recommended to disable the automatic execution of .desktop files.

🌐 The attackers are leveraging Google Drive to host the malware and decoy PDF files, highlighting the importance of scrutinizing links even if they appear to be from legitimate services.
