# SuperCard X Android Malware Exploits NFC Relay Attacks for Payment Fraud

SuperCard X, a new Android malware, uses NFC relay attacks to steal payment card data, enabling fraudulent POS and ATM transactions. Linked to Chinese-speaking threat actors, it evades detection with minimal permissions, Cleafy reports.

Key takeaways:

🦠 SuperCard X, a Malware-as-a-Service platform, employs a dual-app system (“Reader” and “Tapper”) to capture and relay NFC card data via HTTP and mutual TLS, facilitating contactless payment fraud at stores and ATMs.

🎣 Distributed through social engineering, victims are tricked via fake bank alerts into installing the Reader app, which requests only NFC access. The app emulates legitimate cards using stolen Answer to Reset (ATR) data.

🔍 Linked to Chinese-speaking actors and sharing code with NFCGate and NGate, SuperCard X shows no VirusTotal detections, with customized builds seen in Italy, per Cleafy’s analysis.

⚠️ Its low detection profile and focus on NFC relay attacks highlight the growing threat to mobile payment systems, urging users to verify app sources and monitor transactions.
