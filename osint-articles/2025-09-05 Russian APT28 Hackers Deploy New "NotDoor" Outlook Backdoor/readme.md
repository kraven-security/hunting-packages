# Russian APT28 Hackers Deploy New "NotDoor" Outlook Backdoor

The notorious Russian state-sponsored group APT28 has unleashed a new stealthy backdoor called "NotDoor," specifically targeting Microsoft Outlook in NATO countries. This sophisticated malware allows attackers to exfiltrate data, upload files, and execute commands by monitoring incoming emails for a specific trigger word.

Key takeaways:

üîí Stealthy Outlook Integration: NotDoor operates as an obfuscated VBA macro within Outlook, enabling it to monitor emails and await commands from the attackers, all while disabling macro security warnings to remain undetected.

üö® DLL Side-Loading: The malware is deployed using a DLL side-loading technique via Microsoft's OneDrive executable, a method that helps it evade traditional security measures.

üõ°Ô∏è Persistence is Key: NotDoor establishes persistence through Registry modifications and disables Outlook-related dialogue messages, ensuring it remains active and hidden on the compromised system.

üåê Data Exfiltration: The backdoor supports commands to execute commands, exfiltrate files, and drop new files onto the victim's machine, with stolen data being sent to a Proton Mail address.
