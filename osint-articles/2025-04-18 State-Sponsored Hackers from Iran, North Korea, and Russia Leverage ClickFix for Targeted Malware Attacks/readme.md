# State-Sponsored Hackers from Iran, North Korea, and Russia Leverage ClickFix for Targeted Malware Attacks

State-backed hackers from Iran, North Korea, and Russia are using the ClickFix phishing tactic to deploy malware like Quasar RAT, targeting think tanks and organizations. Proofpoint reports that these campaigns, active from November 2024 to February 2025, exploit social engineering to bypass defenses.

Key takeaways:

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Iran‚Äôs TA450 (MuddyWater), North Korea‚Äôs TA427 (Kimsuky), Russia‚Äôs TA422 (APT28), and UNK_RemoteRogue adopted the ClickFix tactic, convincing users to run malicious PowerShell commands for malware deployment, including Quasar RAT and legitimate RMM tools like Level.

üìß TA427 targeted think tanks with spoofed emails posing as a Japanese diplomat, engaging victims in conversation before directing them to attacker-controlled sites, while TA450 mimicked Microsoft security updates to trick users.

üîç ClickFix, initially a cybercrime tool, enhances existing infection chains by replacing payload delivery. It makes attacks harder to detect due to its reliance on user interaction and legitimate-looking instructions.

‚ö†Ô∏è Proofpoint notes these campaigns, spanning November 2024 to February 2025, show state-sponsored groups adapting cybercrime techniques for espionage, urging organizations to strengthen phishing defenses.
