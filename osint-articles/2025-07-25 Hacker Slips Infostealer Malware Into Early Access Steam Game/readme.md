# Hacker Slips Infostealer Malware Into Early Access Steam Game

A threat actor has compromised the early access game "Chemia" on Steam, embedding infostealer malware that runs silently in the background while users play. This attack highlights the potential security risks associated with "work-in-progress" titles on the platform.

Key takeaways:

🚨 Game Compromised: The "Playtest" version of the free game "Chemia" on Steam was injected with malicious binaries designed to steal user data.

🎮 Stealthy Infection: Malware, including HijackLoader and Fickle Stealer, executes in the background without disrupting gameplay, making it difficult for victims to detect.

🦠 Data Theft: The primary goal of the malware is to harvest sensitive information from infected systems, including browser credentials, cookies, and cryptocurrency wallet data.

🔒 Recurring Problem: This is the third reported instance this year of malware being found in an early access Steam game, raising concerns about the security vetting process for such titles.

🛡️ User Action Recommended: Gamers should avoid downloading "Chemia" until it is confirmed safe. If you've already installed the playtest, run a full antivirus scan to check for and remove any threats.
