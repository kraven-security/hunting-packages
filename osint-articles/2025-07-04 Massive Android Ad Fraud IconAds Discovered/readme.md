# Massive Android Ad Fraud "IconAds" Discovered

A huge mobile ad fraud campaign called IconAds, involving 352 Android apps, has been uncovered. These malicious apps hide their icons and bombard users with out-of-context ads, making them difficult to remove.

Key takeaways:

ðŸš¨ The malicious apps hide their icons from the home screen, making them hard for users to find and uninstall.

ðŸ“± The primary goal of these apps is to disrupt the user experience by loading intrusive ads, no matter what app is currently active.

ðŸŽ­ Some of these apps even impersonate the Google Play Store or other legitimate Google apps to deceive users while conducting malicious activities in the background.

ðŸ“ˆ At its peak, this ad fraud operation was responsible for a staggering 1.2 billion ad bid requests per day.
