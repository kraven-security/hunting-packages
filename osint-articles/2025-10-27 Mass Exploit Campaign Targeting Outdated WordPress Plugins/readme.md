# Mass Exploit Campaign Targeting Outdated WordPress Plugins

Threat actors are actively conducting a widespread campaign, exploiting known vulnerabilities in several popular but outdated WordPress plugins. The primary objective is to inject malicious scripts, create rogue administrator accounts, and take full control of vulnerable websites.

Key takeaways:

🚨 Active Mass Scanning: This is not a targeted attack. Hackers are automatically scanning millions of websites for any site running unpatched, vulnerable versions of popular plugins.

🌐 Multiple Plugins at Risk: Active exploits are targeting high-severity vulnerabilities in plugins like WP Meta SEO, LiteSpeed Cache, and WP Statistics, among others. If it's outdated, it's a target.

🔒 Rogue Admin Creation: The main attack vector (often Unauthenticated Stored XSS) allows attackers to create new, hidden administrator accounts, effectively handing them the keys to your site.

🛡️ Persistent Backdoors: Once admin access is gained, attackers install persistent backdoors and malware. This ensures they maintain access even if you later update the vulnerable plugin.

💡 Immediate Action Required: UPDATE ALL PLUGINS NOW. After updating, manually audit all user accounts on your WordPress dashboard. Delete any admin accounts you do not recognize immediately.
