# Slow Pisces Deploys Custom Python Malware in Coding Challenge Scam Targeting Crypto Developers

North Korea‚Äôs Slow Pisces lures crypto developers with fake job offers and malicious coding challenges, deploying RN Loader and RN Stealer malware. Unit 42 reports the group stole over $1B from the crypto sector in 2023, exploiting LinkedIn and GitHub.

Key takeaways:

üé£ Social Engineering Scam: Slow Pisces, a North Korean state-sponsored group, impersonates recruiters on LinkedIn, sending crypto developers malicious coding challenges disguised as job tasks, and infecting systems with RN Loader and RN Stealer.

ü¶† Custom Malware: The malware, hidden in compromised GitHub repositories, uses YAML deserialization to execute payloads, avoiding detection by bypassing suspicious Python functions like eval or exec.

üí∞ Massive Heists: Linked to thefts of $308M from Bitcoin.DMM.com and $1.5B from a Dubai exchange, Slow Pisces targets the crypto sector with precise, controlled attacks to maximize financial gain.

üõ°Ô∏è Shared Intelligence: Palo Alto Networks‚Äô Unit 42 collaborated with GitHub and LinkedIn to dismantle malicious accounts and repositories, urging developers to verify job offers and scan repositories for threats.
