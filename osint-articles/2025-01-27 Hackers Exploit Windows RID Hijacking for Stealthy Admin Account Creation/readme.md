# Hackers Exploit Windows RID Hijacking for Stealthy Admin Account Creation

Cyber attackers are using a new technique known as Windows RID hijacking to create hidden administrator accounts, evading standard detection methods. This method allows them to maintain persistent access while remaining under the radar.

Key takeaways:

🧑‍💻 RID Hijacking: Hackers manipulate the Relative Identifier (RID) to create accounts with admin privileges that look like pre-existing system accounts, effectively hiding them from plain sight.

🔒 Stealth Creation: By assigning a low RID value, these accounts mimic legitimate system accounts, making them less noticeable during routine checks.

👀 Evasion: This technique bypasses many security tools that rely on account enumeration and standard user account monitoring.

🔄 Persistence: The hidden admin accounts can persist even after system reboots or updates, allowing attackers long-term access to the compromised system.

🛡️ Countermeasures: To detect such stealthy activities, enhanced monitoring for account creation and behavior anomalies, along with frequent audits of user accounts, are recommended.
