# Windows NTLM Hash Leak Vulnerability Exploited in Phishing Attacks Targeting Governments

A Windows flaw (CVE-2025-24054) leaking NTLM hashes via .library-ms files is being exploited in phishing campaigns targeting governments in Poland and Romania. Patched in March 2025, Microsoft urges all organizations to update and disable NTLM to block these attacks.

Key takeaways:

üé£ Phishing Campaign: Hackers exploit CVE-2025-24054, a Windows vulnerability that exposes NTLM hashes through .library-ms files. They target government entities and private firms in Poland and Romania with phishing emails containing Dropbox links or direct attachments.

üîì Exploit Mechanism: Opening malicious .library-ms files triggers NTLM authentication to attacker-controlled SMB servers, capturing hashes for potential replay or brute-force attacks, requiring no user interaction beyond file access.

üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Urged: Microsoft patched the flaw in March 2025's Patch Tuesday; organizations should apply updates, disable NTLM where possible, and adopt Kerberos or Negotiate authentication to prevent further exploitation.
