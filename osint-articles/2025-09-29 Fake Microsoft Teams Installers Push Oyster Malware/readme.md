# Fake Microsoft Teams Installers Push Oyster Malware

A sophisticated malvertising campaign is using fake Microsoft Teams installers to distribute the "Oyster" backdoor malware. The campaign uses SEO poisoning to lure users, particularly IT administrators, into downloading the malicious software from convincing but fake websites.

Key takeaways:

🔒 Malvertising and SEO Poisoning: The attackers are using paid ads and manipulating search results to make their fake download pages appear legitimate.

🛡️ Signed But Malicious: The fake installer is code-signed, making it appear trustworthy to unsuspecting users.

💡 Persistence is Key: The malware creates a scheduled task to run every 11 minutes, ensuring it remains active on the compromised system.

🌐 Targeting a High-Value Audience: The campaign specifically targets IT administrators to gain privileged access to corporate networks.
