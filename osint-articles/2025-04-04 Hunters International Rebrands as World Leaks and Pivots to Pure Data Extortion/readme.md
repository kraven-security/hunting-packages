# Hunters International Rebrands as "World Leaks" and Pivots to Pure Data Extortion

Hunters International ditches ransomware for a data extortion-only model, rebranding as "World Leaks" with a new exfiltration tool—launched Jan 1, 2025, after a fake shutdown. Group-IB warns this shift could hit more victims with leaks, not locks!

Key takeaways:

🕵️‍♂️ Rebrand Reveal: Hunters International, once a ransomware powerhouse, relaunched as "World Leaks" on January 1, 2025, focusing solely on data theft and extortion after faking a shutdown in November 2024.

🛠️ New Toolset: Their custom "Storage Software" exfiltration tool got an upgrade, powering a streamlined extortion model without encryption, targeting victims globally.

📉 Strategic Shift: Faced with declining ransomware profits and law enforcement pressure, the group’s pivot (spotted by Group—IB) aims to maximize impact via leaks, with 280+ victims already hit.

🌐 Ongoing Threat: Despite the rebrand, their dark web leak site (active since October 2023) keeps pressuring victims, offering decryption only after payment.
