# BellaCPP: Discovering a new BellaCiao variant written in C++

Kaspersky researchers have uncovered BellaCPP, a C++ variant of the known .NET malware BellaCiao, used by the Charming Kitten threat actor. This new version increases stealth and persistence on Windows systems.

Key takeaways:

üîÑ From .NET to C++: BellaCPP represents a shift from the original BellaCiao, which was written in .NET, to a C++ implementation for improved performance and evasion.
üñ•Ô∏è Windows Service: The malware operates as a Windows service, using the same domain generation algorithm and communication methods to maintain persistence.
üßë‚Äçüíª Charming Kitten Link: There's medium-to-high confidence linking BellaCPP to the Iranian state-sponsored group Charming Kitten, based on shared tactics and infrastructure.
üîç Discovery Context: Found during an investigation of a machine already compromised by BellaCiao, indicating an escalation in the attack strategy.
üõ°Ô∏è Analysis Challenges: The exact functionality of some components like the "SecurityUpdate" function remains speculative due to missing DLLs in the analysis.
