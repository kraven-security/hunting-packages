🗞️ New Polyglot Malware Targets Aviation and Satellite Firms in UAE

Sneaky polyglot malware is hitting aviation and satellite firms in the UAE, hiding malicious payloads in legit-looking files. With critical transport orgs in the crosshairs, this attack’s evasion tactics are a wake-up call.

Key takeaways:

🕵️‍♂️ Stealthy Threat: An undocumented polyglot malware, blending multiple file formats (PDF, HTA, ZIP), is targeting aviation, satellite comms, and transport firms in the UAE, spotted by Positive Technologies in late 2024.

🔍 Evasion Master: It starts with phishing emails, using a benign PDF front to slip past security tools, then deploys HTA and ZIP payloads via PowerShell to dodge detection.

⚙️ Attack Chain: The malware leverages LNK files and obfuscated scripts to install backdoors, targeting critical orgs with sneaky persistence tricks.

🌍 High Stakes: Aimed at the UAE’s vital sectors, it’s unclear who’s behind it—state actors or cybercriminals—but the intent is serious disruption or espionage.

🛡️ Defense Up: Block risky file types (LNK, HTA, ZIP), scan emails rigorously, and train staff to spot phishing—multilayered security is the only way to fight this!
