# DeepSeek AI Tools Impersonated by Infostealer Malware on PyPI

Cybercriminals have infiltrated PyPI with fake DeepSeek AI packages, 'deepseeek' and 'deepseekai,' which are actually info stealers. Developers, beware, and always verify the authenticity of packages before installation!

Key takeaways:

🕵️ Malicious Packages: Two packages, 'deepseeek' and 'deepseekai', were found on PyPI. They impersonate tools for the popular DeepSeek AI platform but are, in fact, information stealers.

🚫 Data Theft: Once installed, these packages steal sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and permissions, posing a significant security risk to users.

🕒 Recent Development: The malicious packages were uploaded on January 29, 2025, and although PyPI removed them, they managed to accumulate 222 downloads, indicating potential exposure.

🔍 Detection: Positive Technologies researchers discovered the attack and reported the issue to PyPI, which removed the packages.

🛡️ Security Measures: This incident underscores the need for developers to use package verification tools, maintain up-to-date security practices, and perhaps use package managers with built-in security checks.
