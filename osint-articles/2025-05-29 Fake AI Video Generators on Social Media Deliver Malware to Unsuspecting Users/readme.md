# Fake AI Video Generators on Social Media Deliver Malware to Unsuspecting Users

Cybercriminals are exploiting interest in AI video tools by using fake ads on Facebook and LinkedIn to trick users into downloading malware, such as Starkveil and XWorm. The campaign, linked to Vietnam-based UNC6032, has reached millions, stealing credentials and crypto data.

Key takeaways:

🕵️‍♂️ Deceptive AI Lures: Cybercriminals promote fake AI video generators, such as “Dream Machine,” via Facebook and LinkedIn ads, leading users to fraudulent websites that deliver malware, including Starkveil and XWorm.

💻 Malware Payloads: The Starkveil dropper, a Rust-based Trojan, requires double execution to deploy infostealers and backdoors, targeting credentials, cookies, and cryptocurrency data, impacting a wide range of industries.

🌐 Massive Reach: Mandiant identified thousands of UNC6032-linked ads that reached over 22 million users, leveraging hacked accounts and spoofed sites that mimicked Canva and Luma to evade detection.

🔍 Sophisticated Tactics: The campaign utilizes AI-generated voices and videos, with some TikTok lures evading security by embedding malicious PowerShell commands within video instructions.

🛡️ Defense Recommendations: Users should verify website authenticity, avoid downloading untrusted software, and use anti-malware tools like Malwarebytes to detect and block these threats.
