# "ShadowV2" Botnet Exploits Misconfigured AWS Docker Containers for DDoS-for-Hire

A new and sophisticated "DDoS-for-Hire" botnet, named ShadowV2, is actively exploiting misconfigured Docker containers on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to launch powerful DDoS attacks. The botnet uses advanced techniques to bypass security measures and offers a user-friendly interface for launching attacks.

Key takeaways:

🔒 Misconfiguration is the Entry Point: The primary attack vector is misconfigured Docker containers, highlighting the critical importance of secure cloud configurations.

🛡️ Sophisticated Attack Methods: ShadowV2 utilizes advanced techniques like HTTP/2 Rapid Reset and methods to bypass Cloudflare's "Under Attack" mode, making it a formidable threat.

💡 Cybercrime-as-a-Service: The botnet is being offered as a "DDoS-for-Hire" service, complete with a command-and-control framework and a user-friendly interface.

🌐 Stealthy Deployment: The attackers use a multi-stage deployment process to install their malware within a generic Ubuntu container, making detection more difficult.
