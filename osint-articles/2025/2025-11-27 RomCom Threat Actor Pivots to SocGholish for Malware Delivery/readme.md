# RomCom Threat Actor Pivots to SocGholish for Malware Delivery

A new campaign linked to the Russian-aligned threat actor RomCom (Unit 29155) has been observed using the SocGholish (FakeUpdates) framework to target organizations. This marks the first time RomCom payloads have been deployed via this widespread fake update mechanism to deliver the Mythic Agent malware.

Key takeaways:

⚡ New Tactic: This is the first observed instance of RomCom leveraging the SocGholish JavaScript loader, typically used by financial cybercrime groups, to distribute its espionage tools.

🎯 Targeted Espionage: The campaign specifically targeted a U.S.-based civil engineering company that had previously worked for a city with close ties to Ukraine, highlighting a continued focus on geopolitical interests.

⏱️ Rapid Attack Chain: The time from the initial "fake update" infection to the delivery of the RomCom loader was observed to be less than 30 minutes.

🛡️ Selective Delivery: The malware verifies the victim's Active Directory domain against a known value before delivering the final payload to ensure precise targeting.

🕵️ Attribution: The activity is attributed with medium-to-high confidence to Unit 29155 of Russia's GRU, also known as Void Rabisu or Tropical Scorpius.
