# ShadowV2 Botnet Exploits AWS Outage as Cover for Attacks

Researchers at Darktrace have identified 'ShadowV2,' a sophisticated botnet that leveraged the chaos of a recent AWS outage to test its capabilities against misconfigured Docker APIs. By striking when defenders were distracted by service disruptions, attackers deployed a potent DDoS-as-a-Service platform with reduced risk of detection.

Key takeaways:

🚨 Opportunistic Timing: The attackers utilized the operational noise of the AWS outage as a "smokescreen," launching infection waves when security teams were focused on restoring availability rather than threat hunting.

🎯 Targeting Misconfigurations: The campaign specifically scans for and exploits exposed Docker API endpoints (often on port 2375) within AWS EC2 instances to gain initial access and build custom malicious containers.

☁️ Hiding in Plain Sight: ShadowV2 hosts its Command & Control (C2) infrastructure on GitHub Codespaces, allowing its malicious traffic to blend in seamlessly with legitimate development activity, making blocking difficult.

🦠 DDoS-for-Hire Capabilities: Once established, the botnet offers a "Cybercrime-as-a-Service" platform, capable of launching advanced attacks like HTTP/2 Rapid Reset floods against rented targets.

🛡️ Defense Priority: Organizations must ensure Docker APIs are not exposed to the public internet and should implement strict authentication measures to prevent unauthorized container access.
