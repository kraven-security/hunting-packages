# ShadowRay 2.0 Campaign Hijacks AI Clusters for Crypto Mining & Data Theft

A global campaign dubbed "ShadowRay 2.0" is actively exploiting a critical vulnerability in the Ray open-source framework to compromise AI infrastructure. Attackers are utilizing LLM-generated payloads to convert clusters into self-propagating cryptomining botnets and steal sensitive data.

Key takeaways:

⚠️ Unpatched Vulnerability: The attacks exploit CVE-2023-48022, a critical RCE flaw that remains unfixed because the vendor intends the software for use only in "strictly-controlled" trusted environments. 

🤖 AI-Generated Payloads: The threat actor, tracked as "IronErn440," is deploying sophisticated malware generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) that can self-propagate across nodes. 

📉 Massive Exposure: Researchers report a significant spike in exposure, with over 230,000 Ray servers currently accessible via the public internet. 

🔓 Severe Impact: Beyond mining Monero, the malware is capable of stealing credentials, exfiltrating proprietary AI models, and launching DDoS attacks. 

🛡️ Critical Mitigation: Since no patch exists, administrators must immediately secure clusters using firewall rules, VPNs, and by adding authorization to the Ray Dashboard (default port 8265).
