# Fake GitHub Repos for OSINT & GPT Tools Spreading New PyStoreRAT Malware

A new sophisticated campaign is flooding GitHub with repositories disguised as OSINT utilities, DeFi bots, and GPT wrappers to distribute a dangerous, previously undocumented Remote Access Trojan (RAT) called PyStoreRAT. These malicious tools, often promoted via social media and boosted by fake stars, trick developers and analysts into downloading malware that can steal sensitive data and cryptocurrency.

Key takeaways: 

🚨 Deceptive Disguise: Attackers are publishing repositories that appear to be legitimate development tools or security utilities but contain hidden Python or JavaScript loader stubs to initiate infection. 

🦠 PyStoreRAT Capabilities: This modular malware executes various payload formats (EXE, DLL, PowerShell) and deploys the Rhadamanthys information stealer to harvest credentials and data. 

📈 Social Engineering: The campaign artificially inflates repository metrics (stars and forks) and promotes them on platforms like X and YouTube to gain trust before slipping in malicious code via "maintenance" updates. 

🙈 Stealth & Evasion: The malware actively checks for specific antivirus products (like CrowdStrike Falcon) and uses legitimate system processes (mshta.exe) to execute payloads while remaining undetected. 

💰 Targeting Crypto: Once installed, the malware scans for cryptocurrency wallet files associated with Ledger Live, Trezor, Exodus, and others to steal assets.
