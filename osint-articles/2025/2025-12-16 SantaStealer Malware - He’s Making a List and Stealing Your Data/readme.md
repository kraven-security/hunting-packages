# SantaStealer Malware: He’s Making a List and Stealing Your Data

A new Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) threat called "SantaStealer" has emerged, designed to siphon sensitive data from browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, and gaming accounts while attempting to evade detection by operating solely in memory.

Key takeaways:

🕵️‍♂️ Stealth Claims: Advertised as a memory-only threat to bypass antivirus detection, though researchers found early samples were actually quite easy to analyze.

🪙 Broad Targets: The malware uses 14 distinct modules to steal everything from crypto wallet keys and Steam session data to browser cookies and credit card info.

🔓 Chrome Bypass: It includes specific capabilities to bypass Google Chrome's recent App-Bound Encryption protections.

💸 MaaS Model: The tool is being sold on hacker forums by a likely Russian-speaking developer for subscription fees ranging from $175 to $300 per month.
