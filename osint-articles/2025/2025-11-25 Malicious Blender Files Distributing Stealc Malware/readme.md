# Malicious Blender Files Distributing Stealc Malware

Cybercriminals are actively targeting the 3D modeling community by hiding the "Stealc" infostealer inside compromised .blend files on popular asset platforms like CGTrader. When opened with scripts enabled, these files execute code that steals sensitive data, including cryptocurrency wallets and browser credentials.

Key takeaways:

🕵️‍♂️ Hidden Danger: Attackers embed malicious Python scripts (often named Rig_Ui.py) inside otherwise functional 3D models.

⚠️ The Trigger: The malware executes immediately if the "Auto Run Python Scripts" feature is enabled in Blender, a common setting for complex rigs.

🦠 The Payload: The script deploys Stealc V2, an aggressive infostealer capable of harvesting data from over 23 browsers and 15 desktop wallets.

🛡️ Immediate Action: Disable "Auto Run Python Scripts" in your Blender settings (Edit > Preferences > Save & Load) to block automatic execution.

💡 Best Practice: Treat third-party .blend files with the same caution as executable files; inspect scripts before allowing them to run.
