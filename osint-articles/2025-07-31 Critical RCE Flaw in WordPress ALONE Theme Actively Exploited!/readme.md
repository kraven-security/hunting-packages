# Critical RCE Flaw in WordPress ALONE Theme Actively Exploited!

Hackers are actively exploiting a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the WordPress 'ALONE' theme, allowing them to take full control of vulnerable websites. The flaw enables unauthenticated attackers to upload malicious files, create hidden administrator accounts, and install backdoors for persistent access.

Key takeaways:

🚨 Update Immediately: If your website uses the 'ALONE' theme, you must update to version 7.8.5 right away to patch this critical vulnerability. All versions up to 7.8.3 are at risk.

🔒 Check for Compromise: Search for any newly created administrator accounts you don't recognize. Inspect your server for suspicious ZIP files or unexpected plugins, and review logs for requests to admin-ajax.php?action=alone_import_pack_install_plugin.

🛡️ Proactive Threat Hunting: The attacks began before the vulnerability was publicly disclosed, serving as a stark reminder that threat actors are constantly searching for new exploits. A proactive security posture is essential.

🌐 Non-Profits Targeted: The 'ALONE' theme is widely used by non-profit organizations, making them a prime target for these attacks. It's crucial to ensure these organizations are aware of the threat.
