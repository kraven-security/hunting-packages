# TamperedChef Malware: Your Free PDF Editor Could Be a Trap!

A new malware campaign is using fake PDF editors to distribute 'TamperedChef,' an information stealer designed to harvest your credentials and web cookies. The campaign leverages malvertising to lure unsuspecting victims.

Key takeaways:

🔒 Deceptive Disguise: The malware is bundled with a seemingly legitimate but trojanized PDF editor called 'AppSuite PDF Editor'.

🚨 Malvertising Menace: The campaign uses malicious online ads to direct users to fraudulent download sites.

💡 Delayed Activation: The malware remains dormant for a period, activating its malicious features after the initial installation to evade detection.

🛡️ Data Theft: 'TamperedChef' is designed to steal sensitive information, including credentials and cookies from popular web browsers.

🌐 Backdoor Access: The malware can also function as a backdoor, allowing attackers to execute commands and exfiltrate data.
