# The Dark Side of Sports Betting: Mirror Sites Fueling Gambling Scams

Mirror sites are helping shady gambling operations dodge laws and scam bettors out of millions with tactics like fake domains and vanishing payouts. Malwarebytes dives into how these cons thrive in sports betting—stay safe and stick to legit platforms!

Key takeaways:

🕵️‍♂️ Hidden Threat: Mirror sites let scam betting companies operate in banned regions by duplicating domains, often vanishing after taking your cash—like 1xBet, which faced bans but kept going with hundreds of duplicates.

💰 Big Losses: These sites trick users with unreal bonuses and odds, leading to stolen funds or identity theft when you input personal details, costing bettors millions yearly.

📢 Deceptive Ads: Scammers flood search engines and ads with fake domains (e.g., MostBet’s 40+ mirrors), making it tough to spot legit operators—always check for licenses like UKGC or MGA.

🛡️ Protect Yourself: Use official links, avoid too-good-to-be-true promos, and be wary of sites with multiple URLs to dodge these traps and keep your betting safe.
