# Chinese-Speaking Users Targeted in Malware Campaigns

Two sophisticated malware campaigns are exploiting SEO poisoning to distribute a variety of Remote Access Trojans (RATs), including HiddenGh0st, Winos, and the newly discovered kkRAT. These campaigns target Chinese-speaking users by creating fake websites for popular software to trick them into downloading malicious installers.

Key takeaways:

🔒 SEO Poisoning: Attackers are manipulating search engine results to lead users to malicious websites that look like legitimate software download pages.

💻 Multi-Stage Attacks: The attacks use a complex, multi-stage infection process to deliver the malware and evade detection.

🛡️ Antivirus Evasion: The malware is designed to disable several popular antivirus products to remain undetected.

💰 Cryptocurrency Theft: A primary goal of these attacks is to steal cryptocurrency by hijacking digital wallets and manipulating clipboard data.

🌐 New Malware: The discovery of the kkRAT highlights the constantly evolving threat landscape and the need for continuous vigilance.
