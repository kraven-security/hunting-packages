Obscure#Bat malware is spreading through fake CAPTCHA pages, tricking users into installing a rootkit (r77) that hides files and steals data. Securonix researchers warn this multi-stage attack mimics Tor Browser and VoIP app.

Key takeaways:

🕵️‍♂️ Deceptive Start: Obscure#Bat lures victims with fake CAPTCHA pages or downloads posing as Tor Browser and VoIP apps, tricking them into running malicious MSI installers.

💻 Rootkit Payload: It deploys the r77 rootkit, fileless malware that hides processes, files, and registry entries. It aims to steal credentials and maintain persistence.

🔒 Stealth Tactics: Using API hooking and trace deletion, it evades detection while exfiltrating data like browser cookies via Telegram bots.

🌐 Wide Threat: Securonix spotted this active campaign since late 2024, targeting users globally with social engineering and deceptive downloads.

🛡️ Protect Yourself: To block this sneaky threat, avoid unverified CAPTCHAs or downloads, use updated antivirus, and monitor systems for suspicious activity.
