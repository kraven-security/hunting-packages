# Medusa Ransomware Deploys Malicious ABYSSWORKER Driver to Neutralize Anti-Malware Defenses

Medusa ransomware is stepping up its game, using a malicious driver dubbed ABYSSWORKER to disable EDR tools with stolen certificates. Elastic Security Labs warns this sneaky BYOVD attack could spell trouble—patch up and stay sharp!

Key takeaways:

🕵️‍♂️ New Tactic Unveiled: Elastic Security Labs spotted Medusa ransomware using a loader (HeartCrypt) and a malicious driver, ABYSSWORKER, to target and shut down endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems in attacks observed by March 17, 2025.

🔓 Driver Deception: Signed with revoked certificates from Chinese firms, ABYSSWORKER (smuol.sys) mimics CrowdStrike’s Falcon driver, bypassing security while enabling RDP access and process termination with a hardcoded password.

💻 Wide Reach: Dozens of ABYSSWORKER samples have surfaced on VirusTotal since August 2024. They can manipulate files and blind EDR by removing callbacks—previously seen in a ConnectWise report as “nbwdv.sys.”

🛡️ Defender’s Move: No active exploits are public yet, but organizations should update EDR, block known IOCs, and monitor for this Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) tactic to stay ahead of Medusa’s evolving threat.
