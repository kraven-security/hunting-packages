# Warning to All Developers: Fake Interviews Are a Trap to Spread Malware

A new and deceptive campaign is targeting developers by luring them into fake job interviews. Attackers are using this social engineering tactic to trick candidates into downloading and running malicious code from at least 35 different npm packages.

Key takeaways:

🚨 Sophisticated Lure: Cybercriminals are using the promise of a job interview to build trust and convince developers to execute malicious files on their systems.

📦 NPM as a Weapon: The attack leverages the npm ecosystem, a critical part of the modern development workflow, to distribute its malicious payloads.

🔒 High-Value Targets: By targeting developers, attackers aim to gain access to sensitive source code, credentials, and critical company infrastructure.

💡 Trust But Verify: Be highly suspicious of any interview process that requires you to download and run software from unfamiliar sources. Always verify the recruiter's and company's legitimacy through separate channels.

🛡️ Secure Your Code: Development teams should implement strict security controls for dependencies and educate members on the rising threat of social engineering attacks that specifically target their roles.
