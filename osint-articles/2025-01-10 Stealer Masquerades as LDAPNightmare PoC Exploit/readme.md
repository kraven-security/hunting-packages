# Stealer Masquerades as LDAPNightmare PoC Exploit

Cybercriminals are exploiting the buzz around LDAPNightmare (CVE-2024-49113) by distributing a fake proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit on GitHub that actually installs information-stealing malware. Security experts recommend caution when downloading supposed security tools from unverified sources.

Key takeaways:

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Deceptive Exploit: A fake PoC exploit for LDAPNightmare has been used to distribute information-stealing malware, targeting security researchers.

üì¶ Malicious Fork: The malicious repository appears as a fork of the original, with the Python exploit replaced by an executable (poc.exe) packed with UPX.

‚ö†Ô∏è Security Awareness: This incident underscores the importance of verifying the authenticity of PoC exploits and being wary of executable files in repositories meant for script-based projects.

üíª Trend Micro's Detection: Trend Micro has noted this tactic, highlighting the risks of downloading software from untrustworthy sources under the guise of security research.

üîç Further Details: More information on the LDAP vulnerabilities and protective measures can be found in Trend Micro's related articles and security resources.
