# Russian Phishing Campaigns Exploit Signal’s Device-Linking Feature

Russian hackers are targeting Signal users by exploiting its device-linking feature with fake QR codes, aiming to intercept secure chats. Stay cautious—verify QR codes and avoid scanning from untrusted sources!

Key takeaways:

🕵️‍♂️ Cyber Espionage: Russian threat actors are phishing Signal users, using the app’s “Linked Devices” feature to trick victims into scanning malicious QR codes.

📱 QR Code Deception: Disguised as legit invites (e.g., Kropyva app groups or Signal alerts), these QR codes link devices to attackers, exposing private messages.

🛠️ Tech Tactics: Older campaigns paired this with malware like Infamous Chisel, while newer ones focus on targeted phishing pages tailored to victims’ interests.

🛡️ Protection Push: Signal’s latest update adds safeguards, but users must remain vigilant and avoid unverified QR scans to stay secure.
