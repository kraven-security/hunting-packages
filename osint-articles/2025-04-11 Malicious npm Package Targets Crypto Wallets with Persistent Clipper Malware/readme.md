# Malicious npm Package Targets Crypto Wallets with Persistent Clipper Malware

A malicious npm package, "pdf-to-office," targets Atomic Wallet and Exodus users, swapping crypto addresses to steal funds. Its clipper malware persists even after removal, highlighting the growing threat to software supply chains.

Key takeaways:

🕵️‍♂️ The npm package "pdf-to-office," first published on March 24, 2025, and updated to version 1.1.2 by April 8, has been downloaded 334 times, embedding malicious code to target cryptocurrency wallets.

💻 It checks for Atomic Wallet’s presence on Windows systems and introduces clipper functionality to replace crypto addresses, redirecting funds to attackers.

🛡️ The malware’s persistence after package removal underscores the sophistication of supply chain attacks, following similar incidents with packages like ethers-provider2 and ethers-providerz.

🔍 This discovery by a software supply chain security firm emphasizes the need for developers to scrutinize open-source packages to prevent such stealthy infections.
