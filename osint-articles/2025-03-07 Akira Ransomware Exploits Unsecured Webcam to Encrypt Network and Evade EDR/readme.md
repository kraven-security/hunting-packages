# Akira Ransomware Exploits Unsecured Webcam to Encrypt Network and Evade EDR

The Akira ransomware gang used an unsecured webcam to encrypt a network, bypassing Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools in a clever pivot. With no EDR on the Linux-based device, attackers leveraged SMB shares to strike.

Key takeaways:

🕵️‍♂️ Webcam Weakness: The Akira gang exploited an unsecured webcam running a lightweight Linux OS, vulnerable to remote access and lacking EDR, to launch a ransomware attack, reported on March 6, 2025.

🔓 EDR Bypass: After their Windows encryptor (win.exe) was blocked by EDR, they pivoted to the webcam, using its Linux encryptor to target SMB network shares undetected by Windows-focused defenses.

📡 Stealthy Traffic: The webcam’s spike in SMB traffic went unnoticed by the victim’s security team, letting Akira encrypt files across the network with no alerts raised, per S-RM’s findings.

🌍 IoT Risk: This attack underscores the growing danger of unmonitored IoT devices like webcams and fingerprint scanners as entry points for ransomware—Akira scanned for these after hitting a wall.

🛡️ Lock It Down: Organizations need to monitor all devices, patch IoT vulnerabilities, and extend EDR to non-Windows systems to prevent this sneaky tactic from spreading further.
