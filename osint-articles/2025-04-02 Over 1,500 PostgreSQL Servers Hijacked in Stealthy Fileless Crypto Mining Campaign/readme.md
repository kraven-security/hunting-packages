# Over 1,500 PostgreSQL Servers Hijacked in Stealthy Fileless Crypto Mining Campaign

A sneaky campaign dubbed "CPU_HU" has compromised over 1,500 PostgreSQL servers. It uses fileless malware to mine crypto under the radar of traditional defenses. Weak passwords and misconfigurations are to blame.

Key takeaways:

ü¶† Massive Breach: The "CPU_HU" campaign has targeted over 1,500 cloud-hosted PostgreSQL servers, exploiting weak credentials to deploy fileless crypto miners.

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Evasive Tactics: The JINX-0126 group uses the PG_MEM malware, customized per victim, to mine Monero (XMRig) while dodging detection with in-memory execution.

üîì Vulnerability Exposed: Publicly accessible servers with predictable or weak passwords are prime targets, echoing past attacks like the 2024 PG_MEM wave.

üõ°Ô∏è Call to Action: Wiz researchers urge admins to enforce strong passwords, limit public access, and monitor for suspicious processes to halt this threat.
