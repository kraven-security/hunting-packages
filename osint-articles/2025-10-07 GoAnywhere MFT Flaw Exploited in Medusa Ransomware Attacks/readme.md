# GoAnywhere MFT Flaw Exploited in Medusa Ransomware Attacks

Affiliates of the Medusa ransomware gang are actively exploiting a critical vulnerability in Fortra's GoAnywhere MFT. The flaw (CVE-2025-10035) allows for remote code execution and is being used to gain initial access to networks, leading to data theft and ransomware deployment.

Key takeaways:

🔒 Active Exploitation: The vulnerability was exploited as a zero-day, with attacks beginning at least a week before a patch was available.

🛡️ Multi-Stage Attack: The attackers use a sophisticated chain of tools for persistence, reconnaissance, and lateral movement.

💡 Data Exfiltration: Stolen data is exfiltrated using Rclone before the Medusa ransomware is deployed.

🌐 Patch and Investigate: All GoAnywhere MFT users should upgrade immediately and inspect logs for signs of compromise.
