# "Whitecobra" Floods VSCode Market with Crypto-Stealing Malware

A threat actor known as "Whitecobra" is conducting a large-scale campaign, flooding the Visual Studio Code and Open VSX marketplaces with malicious extensions designed to steal cryptocurrency. These deceptive extensions mimic legitimate tools to trick developers into installing them, posing a significant supply chain risk.

Key takeaways:

üîí Deceptive Tactics: The extensions use professional-looking icons, detailed descriptions, and inflated download counts to appear legitimate, tricking developers into trusting and installing them.

üíª Multi-Platform Attack: The campaign targets multiple code editors, including VSCode, Cursor, and Windsurf, using a cross-platform VSIX extension format to maximize its reach.

üõ°Ô∏è Sophisticated Malware Delivery: The malicious extensions use a multi-stage process, initially appearing harmless but later downloading platform-specific malware like LummaStealer to steal credentials and crypto wallet data.

üí° Organized Operation: Leaked internal documents from Whitecobra reveal a highly organized operation with clear revenue targets and detailed plans for infrastructure and social engineering.
