# CISA Warns of Malware Exploiting Ivanti Zero-Day Vulnerabilities

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued a warning about two new malware strains that are actively exploiting a pair of zero-day vulnerabilities in Ivanti's Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM). These vulnerabilities, when chained together, allow for unauthenticated remote code execution.

Key takeaways:

🔒 Critical Vulnerabilities: The flaws (CVE-2025-4427 and CVE-2025-4428) allow attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary code, giving them significant control over affected systems.

🛡️ Active Exploitation: Threat actors began exploiting these vulnerabilities as zero-days around May 15, 2025, shortly after a proof-of-concept exploit was published.

💡 Data Theft and Persistence: The malware allows attackers to gather system information, download malicious files, dump LDAP credentials, and establish persistence on compromised servers.

🌐 Urgent Patching Required: CISA strongly advises all organizations using Ivanti EPMM to update their systems to the latest version immediately to mitigate this threat.
