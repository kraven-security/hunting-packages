# New VVS Stealer Malware: Is Your Discord Account Being Sold for €10?

Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered VVS Stealer (also known as VVS $tealer), a stealthy Python-based malware being sold on Telegram that specifically targets Discord users and browser data. This "ultimate stealer" uses advanced obfuscation to hijack active Discord sessions and siphon sensitive information, ranging from credit card details to private screenshots.

Key takeaways:

🚨 Advanced Obfuscation: The malware uses Pyarmor and PyInstaller to bypass traditional antivirus detection, making it highly effective at remaining undetected on infected systems.

🐍 Discord Injection Attacks: VVS Stealer doesn't just steal tokens; it injects malicious JavaScript into the Discord client to hijack active sessions and monitor network traffic via Chrome DevTools.

📦 Comprehensive Data Harvesting: Beyond Discord, it extracts passwords, cookies, and autofill data from Chromium and Firefox browsers, compressing the stolen data into ZIP archives for exfiltration.

💸 Low Barrier to Entry: With subscriptions starting as low as €10 per week, this malware is widely accessible to entry-level cybercriminals, increasing the scale of potential attacks.

🛡️ Persistence & Deception: It ensures longevity by adding itself to the Windows Startup folder and uses fake "Fatal Error" pop-ups to trick users into restarting their devices.
