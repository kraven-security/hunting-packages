# New "Massiv" Android Banking Malware Disguised as IPTV App

Cybersecurity researchers have identified a new Android banking Trojan named Massiv that spreads by impersonating a legitimate IPTV streaming application. This malware targets users’ financial data by employing sophisticated overlay attacks and abusing accessibility services to gain full control over infected devices.

Key takeaways

🕵️‍♂️ Deceptive Distribution: Massiv malware disguises itself as a functional IPTV app, leveraging the high demand for streaming services to trick users into downloading malicious APKs from unofficial sources.

🔒 Credential Theft via Overlays: The Trojan uses "overlay attacks" to display fake login screens over legitimate banking and cryptocurrency apps, silently harvesting usernames and passwords.

🛡️ Abuse of Accessibility Services: Once installed, it requests permission to use Android's Accessibility Services, allowing it to intercept 2FA codes, log keystrokes, and prevent users from uninstalling the malicious software.

🌐 Global Financial Target: While currently spreading through third-party app stores, the malware contains code to target hundreds of different banking institutions worldwide, making it a significant threat to mobile users globally.
