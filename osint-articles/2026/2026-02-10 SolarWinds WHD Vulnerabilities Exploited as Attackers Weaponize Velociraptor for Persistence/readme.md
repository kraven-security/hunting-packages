# SolarWinds WHD Vulnerabilities Exploited as Attackers Weaponize Velociraptor for Persistence

Threat actors are weaponizing critical vulnerabilities in SolarWinds Web Help Desk (WHD) to deploy the Velociraptor agent, turning a trusted incident response tool into a stealthy backdoor. By exploiting these flaws, adversaries can maintain long-term persistence and move laterally within compromised networks.

Key takeaways:

🚨 Critical Flaws Exploited: Attackers are leveraging vulnerabilities (including CVE-2024-28986 and CVE-2024-28987) related to hardcoded credentials and remote code execution to gain initial access.

🛡️ Weaponizing Defense Tools: By deploying the legitimate "Velociraptor" agent, hackers can blend into normal IT operations, making it extremely difficult for traditional security tools to detect their presence.

🌐 CISA KEV Warning: The active exploitation of these flaws has prompted CISA to add them to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, signaling an urgent threat to both public and private sectors.

🛠️ Immediate Remediation: Organizations running SolarWinds Web Help Desk must apply the latest security patches immediately to close these entry points and prevent unauthorized administrative access.
