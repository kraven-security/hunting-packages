# Fortinet FortiCloud SSO Zero-Day Exploited in the Wild

Fortinet has confirmed a sophisticated new zero-day attack (CVE-2026-24858) that allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication and gain full administrative control of FortiGate devices. Alarmingly, this campaign has successfully targeted firewalls that were fully patched against previous December 2025 vulnerabilities, signaling a critical new "alternate path" for exploitation.

Key takeaways:

🛡️ Critical Bypass: Attackers are using crafted SAML messages to bypass SSO logins, even on devices running the most recent firmware versions like FortiOS 7.4.10.

🕵️ Rogue Account Creation: Once access is gained, threat actors rapidly create local administrative accounts (e.g., audit, backup, itadmin, secadmin, support) to ensure long-term persistence.

📦 Data Exfiltration: Malicious actors have been observed exporting full device configuration files via the GUI, which likely contain hashed credentials and sensitive network mapping data.

🛑 Immediate Mitigation: Admins should immediately disable the "Allow administrative login using FortiCloud SSO" setting and apply the latest emergency patches (FortiOS 7.4.11+).

🔒 Network Hardening: Restrict administrative access to trusted internal IP addresses only by implementing "local-in" policies to prevent exposure to the public internet.
