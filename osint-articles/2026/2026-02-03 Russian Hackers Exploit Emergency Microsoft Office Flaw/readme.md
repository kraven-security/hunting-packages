# Russian Hackers Exploit Emergency Microsoft Office Flaw

Russian state hackers (APT28) are aggressively weaponizing a newly patched Microsoft Office bypass (CVE-2026-21509) to compromise government entities across Ukraine and the EU. Just days after Microsoft's emergency update, attackers began using social engineering to deploy the COVENANT malware framework via a sophisticated multi-stage infection chain.

Key takeaways

🚨 Rapid Weaponization: APT28 (Fancy Bear) began exploiting this security bypass just 24 hours after an emergency patch was released, proving that nation-state actors are monitoring patch cycles for immediate exploitation opportunities.

🛡️ Sophisticated Stealth: The attack chain utilizes COM hijacking and shellcode hidden within legitimate-looking image files to execute the COVENANT framework, leveraging the Filen cloud service for command-and-control to blend in with normal traffic.

🔒 Critical Versions Affected: The vulnerability impacts Microsoft Office 2016, 2019, LTSC 2021/2024, and Microsoft 365 Apps. Notably, Office 2021 users must restart their applications for the service-side patch to take effect.

🌐 Strategic Targeting: Phishing lures were highly tailored, impersonating EU COREPER consultations and meteorological services to target over 60 government-related addresses across Europe.

💡 Immediate Defense: Security teams should prioritize patching and verifying application restarts. Additionally, monitor or block connections to filen.io and ensure Microsoft Defender’s Protected View is enforced for all internet-sourced documents.
