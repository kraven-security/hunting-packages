# Critical RCE in React Native CLI Under Active Exploitation

Threat actors are weaponizing a critical remote code execution flaw (CVE-2025-11953) in the popular @react-native-community/cli npm package, allowing them to take full control of developer environments. This vulnerability, dubbed "Metro4Shell," poses a severe risk as it bypasses authentication to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying host.

Key takeaways:

🚨 Critical Severity: With a near-perfect CVSS score of 9.8, "Metro4Shell" allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to execute operating system commands via the Metro Development Server.

🕵️‍♂️ Active Malware Delivery: Cybersecurity researchers have observed attackers using the flaw to deliver Base64-encoded PowerShell scripts that deploy sophisticated, anti-analytic Rust-based malware.

🛡️ Stealth Tactics: Current attacks are designed to evade detection by automatically configuring Microsoft Defender exclusions for the current working directory and temporary folders.

🌐 Infrastructure Risk: This campaign highlights a recurring danger: development infrastructure becomes a production-level liability the moment it is reachable over the internet.

🔒 Immediate Mitigation: Developers must audit their network configurations to ensure Metro servers are not internet-facing and update their CLI packages to the latest secured versions immediately.
