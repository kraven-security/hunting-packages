# Hugging Face Abused to Distribute Android Malware

Cybercriminals are now weaponizing the AI community’s trust. A sophisticated new campaign has turned Hugging Face into a repository for over 6,000 variants of a credential-stealing Trojan. Disguised as a security tool called "TrustBastion," this malware uses server-side polymorphism to evade detection and drain financial accounts.

Key takeaways

🤖 Abusing AI Repositories: Threat actors used Hugging Face’s trusted infrastructure and CDN to host malicious APKs, making the downloads appear legitimate to standard network security filters.

🎭 The "Scareware" Hook: Victims are lured via ads claiming their device is infected, prompting the installation of a fake security app that then pushes a "mandatory update" mimicking the Google Play Store.

🔄 Polymorphic Evasion: The attackers utilized server-side automation to commit new malware variants every 15 minutes, resulting in thousands of unique samples to bypass signature-based antivirus tools.

🔓 Accessibility Service Exploitation: Once installed, the malware tricks users into granting Accessibility permissions, allowing it to log keystrokes, capture screens, and overlay fake login pages for apps like Alipay and WeChat.

🛡️ Hygiene is Mandatory: This serves as a critical reminder to disable "Install from Unknown Sources" and to be extremely skeptical of security "alerts" originating from web browsers or third-party ads.
