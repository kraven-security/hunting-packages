# SHADOW#REACTOR Campaign Exploits Windows Tools to Deploy Remcos RAT

Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a sophisticated, multi-stage attack chain dubbed "SHADOW#REACTOR" that is actively targeting enterprise and SMB environments to establish covert remote access. By utilizing a modular, self-healing design and leveraging legitimate Windows binaries, this campaign is specifically engineered to bypass modern endpoint protection and facilitate long-term persistence.

Key takeaways:

🚨 High-Impact Backdoor: The campaign delivers the Remcos RAT, a commercially available but powerful Remote Administration Tool that grants attackers full control over a compromised system, including file exfiltration and keystroke logging.

🎭 Stealth via LOLBins: The final stage of the attack hijacks MSBuild.exe, a legitimate Microsoft development tool, to execute malicious code—a "Living-off-the-Land" (LOLBin) tactic designed to blend in with normal system activity.

🛡️ Advanced Evasion Techniques: To frustrate analysts, the malware uses .NET Reactor-protected loaders and executes almost entirely in-memory, leaving a minimal footprint for traditional antivirus software to detect on the disk.

🏗️ Resilient "Self-Healing" Design: The infection chain includes a unique logic loop that validates the integrity of downloaded fragments; if a payload is blocked or corrupted, the stager automatically attempts to re-fetch it until the infection is complete.

💡 Actionable Defense: Organizations should prioritize monitoring for suspicious child processes of wscript.exe and powershell.exe, and consider restricting the execution of developer tools like MSBuild on non-technical workstations.
