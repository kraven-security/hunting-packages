# APT37 Bridges the Gap: New Malware Targets "Isolated" Networks

The North Korean-linked threat group APT37 is now deploying a new malware strain, dubbed "SHROUDED#SLEEP," specifically engineered to breach air-gapped networks. By leveraging infected USB drives to "jump" the air gap, this campaign proves that physical isolation is no longer a guarantee of security against determined state-sponsored actors.

Key takeaways:

🔌 Physical Vector Exploitation: The attack relies on "Sneakernet" tactics, using malicious files on USB drives to infiltrate systems without a direct internet connection.

📸 Automated Stealth Exfiltration: Once a device is infected, the malware automatically captures screenshots, logs keystrokes, and harvests sensitive files, storing them back on the USB for later retrieval.

🧹 Advanced Anti-Forensics: To remain undetected, the malware utilizes a "wash-and-dry" technique, systematically deleting temporary files and event logs to frustrate incident responders and forensic analysts.

🛡️ Actionable Defense: This threat highlights the urgent need to disable AutoRun, enforce strict USB device control policies, and implement hardware-level port blocking on sensitive workstations.
