# New Malware Strategy Uses Real Browser Crashes to Breach Corporate Networks

A dangerous malvertising campaign is deploying a fake ad-blocker extension named "NexShield" that intentionally crashes your browser to set the stage for a "CrashFix" social engineering attack. Once the browser is restarted, users are lured into executing malicious PowerShell commands that install the sophisticated ModeloRAT in corporate environments.

Key takeaways

🎭 Highly Deceptive Impersonation: The malicious "NexShield" extension was promoted as a lightweight ad-blocker from the creator of uBlock Origin to trick users into a false sense of security before striking.

📉 Intentional DoS Attack: The malware creates an infinite loop that exhausts memory resources, forcing a real browser crash to create the high-stress urgency needed for its subsequent "fake fix" scam.

⌨️ The Clipboard Trap: Following the "ClickFix" playbook, the attack tricks users into copying and pasting a "fixing" command into their Windows Command Prompt, which triggers a multi-stage PowerShell infection chain.

🏢 Corporate Reconnaissance: On enterprise systems, the campaign deploys "ModeloRAT," a Python-based remote access tool designed for system fingerprinting, registry modification, and remote command execution.

🛡️ Persistence Warning: Simply uninstalling the browser extension is not enough; infected systems require a comprehensive security cleanup as the RAT operates independently of the browser once it gains a foothold.
