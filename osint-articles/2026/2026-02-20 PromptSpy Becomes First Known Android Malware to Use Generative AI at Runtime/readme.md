# "PromptSpy" Becomes First Known Android Malware to Use Generative AI at Runtime

Security researchers have uncovered PromptSpy, a groundbreaking Android Trojan that integrates Google’s Gemini AI directly into its execution flow to achieve unprecedented levels of persistence. By using AI to dynamically interpret and navigate a device's user interface, this malware bypasses the limitations of traditional, hardcoded scripts, allowing it to adapt to nearly any screen layout or OS version.

Key takeaways

🤖 AI-Driven Persistence: PromptSpy sends natural-language prompts and XML screen dumps to Gemini, receiving real-time JSON instructions on how to perform specific gestures to "lock" itself in the recent apps list, preventing users from swiping it away.

🔒 Full Remote Hijacking: The primary objective is deploying a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) module, granting attackers complete remote access to view the screen, record video, and perform manual taps or swipes as if they were holding the phone.

🛡️ Invisible Defense: The malware abuses Android Accessibility Services to place invisible overlays on the screen, effectively blocking users from tapping "Uninstall" or "Force Stop" buttons within settings.

🌐 Targeted Espionage: Currently appearing as a "MorganArg" banking app targeting users in Argentina, the code contains debug strings in Simplified Chinese, suggesting a sophisticated, financially motivated developer group behind the operation.
