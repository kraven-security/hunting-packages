# Legitimate Developer Account Hijacked to Spread GlassWorm Malware

Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a sophisticated supply chain attack targeting the Open VSX Registry, where four established extensions were poisoned to deliver the GlassWorm malware loader. These legitimate tools, which accumulated over 22,000 downloads, were compromised to harvest macOS credentials and sensitive developer data from enterprise environments.

Key takeaways

🥸  Trusted Accounts Exploited: The campaign bypassed traditional "brandjacking" defenses by hijacking a legitimate developer account ('oorzc') to push malicious updates to established, high-trust extensions.

🦠 GlassWorm Stealth Tactics: The poisoned versions use "EtherHiding"—leveraging Solana memos as dynamic dead drops—to fetch C2 instructions, hiding execution behind encrypted loaders to evade static analysis.

🍎 Targeted macOS Data Theft: The malware is specifically tuned to exfiltrate iCloud Keychains, Safari cookies, Apple Notes, and cryptocurrency wallets like MetaMask and Ledger Live from macOS users.

🛡️ Lateral Movement Risk: Attackers are aggressively harvesting AWS tokens, SSH keys, and npm authentication materials, directly threatening private repositories and cloud infrastructure.

💡 Immediate Action Required: Audit your VS Code and Open VSX environments for any extensions published by 'oorzc.' Move beyond static indicators toward behavioral detection to spot unauthorized outbound credential exfiltration.
