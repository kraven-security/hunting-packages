# New "ClickFix" Attack Abuses Trusted Microsoft App-V Scripts to Deploy Malware

Cybercriminals have evolved the notorious "ClickFix" tactic, now abusing a signed Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) script to bypass security filters. By tricking users into running a command via a fake CAPTCHA, attackers are successfully deploying the Amatera infostealer while hiding malicious activity behind trusted Windows components.

Key takeaways

🛠️ Living-off-the-Land (LotL): The attack leverages a legitimate, signed Microsoft script (SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs) to proxy the execution of PowerShell, making the malicious behavior appear as a trusted system process.

🧩 Fake CAPTCHA Deception: Victims are lured to a site showing a fake human verification check that instructs them to manually paste a malicious command into the Windows "Run" dialog.

🖼️ Stealthy Steganography: To evade network detection, the campaign hides its secondary payloads inside seemingly harmless PNG images hosted on public CDNs, extracting the code only once it's in memory.

📅 Google Calendar C2: The malware retrieves its configuration data from base64-encoded values hidden within public Google Calendar events, further blending in with legitimate web traffic.

🛡️ Actionable Defense: Organizations should consider restricting access to the Windows Run dialog (via GPO), removing unused App-V components, and enabling enhanced PowerShell logging to detect these sophisticated execution chains.
