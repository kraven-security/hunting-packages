# Russian Bulletproof Host Proton66 Fuels Global Cyberattacks and Malware Surge

Since January 2025, hackers have exploited Russian bulletproof host Proton66 to launch global cyberattacks, targeting critical vulnerabilities and spreading malware like XWorm and SuperBlack ransomware. Trustwave SpiderLabs warns of its role in mass scanning and brute-forcing, urging stronger network defenses.

Key takeaways:

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Proton66, a Russian bulletproof hosting provider linked to PROSPERO, has been used since January 8, 2025, for mass scanning, credential brute-forcing, and exploiting vulnerabilities, targeting organizations worldwide.

üåê Active net blocks (45.135.232.0/24, 45.140.17.0/24, 193.143.1.65) targeted critical CVEs in February 2025, including Palo Alto PAN-OS (CVE-2025-0108), Fortinet FortiOS (CVE-2024-55591, CVE-2025-24472), and D-Link NAS (CVE-2024-10914).

ü¶† Malware campaigns via Proton66 distribute XWorm, StrelaStealer, and WeaXor ransomware, with Fortinet exploits tied to initial access broker Mora_001 delivering the SuperBlack ransomware strain.

‚ö†Ô∏è The service‚Äôs history on Russian cybercrime forums, under names like Securehost and BEARHOST, highlights its role in enabling persistent, hard-to-trace attacks, necessitating robust security measures.
