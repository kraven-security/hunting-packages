# New "Chaos" Malware Hijacks Discord for Command-and-Control

A new Rust-based backdoor, dubbed "ChaosBot," is using Discord for command-and-control, while a new variant of the Chaos ransomware is adding destructive capabilities and a crypto-stealing clipboard hijacker.

Key takeaways:

🔒 Discord as C2: ChaosBot uses Discord channels for its command-and-control, making it harder to detect and block.

🛡️ Destructive Ransomware: The new Chaos ransomware variant deletes large files instead of encrypting them, making data recovery impossible without backups.

💡 Crypto Theft: The ransomware also includes a clipboard hijacker that replaces Bitcoin addresses to steal cryptocurrency.

🌐 Multiple Infection Vectors: The malware is being spread through compromised credentials, WMI, and phishing emails.
