# New Golang-Based Backdoor Leverages Telegram for Evasive C2 Operations

Researchers have discovered a Golang-based backdoor that uses Telegram's Bot API for command-and-control, executing PowerShell commands and self-destructing to evade detection. This malware, possibly of Russian origin, highlights the evolving use of social platforms in cyber attacks.

Key takeaways:

ðŸ˜ˆ Suspected Russian Origin: The malware's characteristics suggest it may have been developed by Russian actors.

ðŸ“² Telegram C2: Utilizes Telegram's Bot API for command and control communications, making it hard to block.

ðŸ’» Golang Advantage: Compiled in Go, offering cross-platform capabilities and evasion of traditional security measures.

ðŸ”„ Self-Destructing: Once executed, it checks for specific conditions before copying itself and then terminates to avoid detection.

ðŸš¨ Security Concerns: The backdoor's ability to execute PowerShell commands and maintain low visibility raises significant security concerns.
