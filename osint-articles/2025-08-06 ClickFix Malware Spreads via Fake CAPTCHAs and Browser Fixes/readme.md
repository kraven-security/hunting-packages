# "ClickFix" Malware Spreads via Fake CAPTCHAs and Browser Fixes

A cunning malware campaign, dubbed "ClickFix," is exploiting user trust to infect systems across multiple platforms. This social engineering tactic tricks users into copying and pasting malicious code into their systems, disguised as a solution to a fake problem like a CAPTCHA verification or a browser error.

Key takeaways:

🚨 Don't Trust, Verify: Be wary of any website or pop-up that instructs you to manually copy and paste code, especially into a command line or terminal.

🛡️ Source Matters: If a website prompts you to take unusual steps to view content, it's a major red flag. Close the tab and do not follow the instructions.

💡 Clipboard Hijacking: This attack relies on "pastejacking," where the website secretly copies malicious code to your clipboard. Always be aware of what you are pasting.

🌐 Stay Updated: Keep your operating system and software patched to the latest versions to mitigate vulnerabilities that malware often targets.
🔒 Security Software is Key: A robust antivirus or endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution can help detect and block the malicious payloads delivered by ClickFix.
