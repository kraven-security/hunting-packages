# Critical WinRAR Zero-Day Under Active Exploitation

A critical zero-day vulnerability in WinRAR is being actively exploited by hacking groups to install malware on target PCs. The flaw allows attackers to gain remote code execution by tricking users into opening a specially crafted RAR archive.

Key takeaways:

🚨 Path Traversal Flaw: The vulnerability is a path traversal issue that enables attackers to drop malicious files into sensitive locations, like the Windows Startup folder, ensuring the malware runs automatically.

🔒 Stealthy Infection: Attackers are using clever techniques, like hiding payloads in Alternate Data Streams (ADS), to evade detection when the malicious archive is opened.

💡 Manual Update Required: WinRAR does not have an automatic update function. This means users are not protected unless they manually download and install the latest patched version.

🛡️ Immediate Action Needed: All users should immediately update to WinRAR version 7.13 or newer to patch this vulnerability and prevent potential system compromise.

🌐 Popular Target: The widespread use of WinRAR makes it a high-value target for threat actors seeking to distribute malware broadly.
