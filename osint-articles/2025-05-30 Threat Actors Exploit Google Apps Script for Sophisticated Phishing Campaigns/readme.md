# Threat Actors Exploit Google Apps Script for Sophisticated Phishing Campaigns

Threat actors are leveraging Google Apps Script to host phishing pages on trusted Google domains, evading detection and stealing credentials with fake login screens. Cofense researchers urge organizations to scrutinize cloud service links and block suspicious Google Apps Script URLs to counter these stealthy attacks.

Key takeaways:

🕵️‍♂️ Trusted Platform Abuse: Threat actors use Google Apps Script to host phishing pages on script.google.com, a trusted domain, bypassing security filters and appearing legitimate to users.

📧 Deceptive Phishing Tactics: Phishing emails with links to fake login pages, designed to mimic legitimate services, capture credentials before redirecting victims to authentic sites to reduce suspicion.

🔄 Dynamic Attack Flexibility: Attackers can remotely modify scripts to switch lures without resending links, enhancing evasion and operational efficiency.

🔍 Cofense Discovery: Security researchers at Cofense identified this trend, noting the scripts’ ability to exfiltrate stolen data via hidden requests to attacker-controlled servers.

🛡️ Defense Recommendations: Configure email security to flag or block Google Apps Script URLs, enhance user training, and monitor cloud service activity to detect phishing attempts.
