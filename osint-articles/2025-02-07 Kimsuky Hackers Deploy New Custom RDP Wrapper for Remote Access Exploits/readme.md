# Kimsuky Hackers Deploy New Custom RDP Wrapper for Remote Access Exploits

The North Korean hacker group Kimsuky has been spotted using a custom RDP Wrapper to gain remote access to compromised machines. The group is shifting from traditional backdoors like PebbleDash to more sophisticated tools for stealthier operations.

Key takeaways:

💻 New Tool: Kimsuky employs a custom-built RDP Wrapper for direct remote machine access.

🔄 Tactical Shift: The transition from loud backdoors like PebbleDash to less detectable RDP tools highlights the group's evolving tactics for maintaining persistence and control over infected systems.

🛡️ Evasion: The use of RDP Wrapper helps in evading antivirus and firewall detection.

🔐 Access Methods: They use LNK files and proxy malware to facilitate RDP connections post-compromise.

🔍 Detection: The shift suggests Kimsuky is adapting to improve persistence and control while reducing visibility.
