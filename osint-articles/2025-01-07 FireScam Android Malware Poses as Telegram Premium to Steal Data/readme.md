# FireScam Android Malware Poses as Telegram Premium to Steal Data

A new Android malware, FireScam, is masquerading as a Telegram Premium app, stealing data and controlling devices. It's distributed through phishing sites mimicking RuStore, with the potential to compromise millions.

Key takeaways:

📲 Disguised as Telegram Premium: FireScam exploits the popularity of Telegram by posing as its premium version, tricking users into downloading it for enhanced features.

🔓 Data Exfiltration: Once installed, it seeks permissions to access personal data like contacts, messages, and call logs, forwarding this information to attackers.

🕵️‍♂️ Surveillance Features: Beyond data theft, FireScam monitors notifications, screen state changes, and even e-commerce transactions to gather more intelligence.

🔗 Phishing Distribution: It's spread via GitHub.io-hosted sites that falsely claim to be the RuStore App Store, a popular platform in Russia, to evade detection.

🔒 Persistent Control: The malware registers a service to receive commands via Firebase Cloud Messaging, allowing it to maintain covert access to the device.
